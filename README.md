A small collection of the projects I worked on during CPEN436 Biomedical Informatics class at Gonzaga.


Project 10: This project parses html files into usable text files. It then sends requests to a UMLS service MetaMap, which returns relevant medical information from the given text file.
This project requires an account with the Unified Medical Language System through the National Library of Medicine to run. I have omitted my credentials. The data folder in the project folder should be placed in the C: drive.


Project 11: This project ranks the html files from the previous project in accordance to a given query of Concept Unique Identifiers that MetaMap uses to label medical terms. It then calculates a few relevant statistical quantities based on the html files and the query. 


MUTARA: This project was the final for the course. The goal was to search several databases set up earlier in the course and find correlation between certain drugs and their adverse effects. There was several methods to determine these associations, but I chose to use the Mining Unexpected Temporal Association Rules Algorithm (MUTARA). 
These databases include patient's symptoms, medical history, prescribed drugs, and various metadata. I have omitted my credentials.
