Radiolabeled CRE probe incubated with a nuclear extract from NMDA-stimulated SK-N-SH cells formed complexes that were observed on nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels as one strong band and one weaker band (Fig. 2B, bands a and b). To show that these complexes contain the CREB protein, anti-CREB monoclonal antibody was added to the reaction, and the observed band was supershifted to an apparently higher molecular weight (Fig. 2C, band ss).

Processing 00000000.tx.193: -Fold inductions are shown. 

Phrase: "- To test whether the PS1-CRE element identified in the proximal promoter could participate in transcriptional activity, we combined this element with a firefly luciferase reporter (Promega; pGL3-basic vector) to look for CREB-mediated activity in human SK-N-SH cells of neuronal origin. As an internal standard, we used the pRL-TK vector (Promega), which contains the Renilla luciferase gene driven by a herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase promoter. Of all of the DNA fragments tested for promoter activity, plasmid LUC-3 with the human PS-1 fragment 297 to +189 showed the greatest amount of firefly luciferase activity relative to the Renilla luciferase internal control. This ratio of LUC-3 activity to Renilla activity was defined as 100% of relative promoter activity (100% RPA) (Fig. 3A). Larger DNA fragments such as LUC-4 (1191 to +189) and LUC-5 (4311 to +189) displayed 84% and 25% of the LUC-3 activity (84% and 25% RPA). LUC-1 (297 to +1258) and LUC-2 (1191 to +1258) each displayed less than 10% RPA, suggesting that they contained negative elements that apparently reduce overall promoter activity. Although LUC-6 (18 to +8) was the shortest fragment tested, it contains a putative CREB binding site and a putative Elk-1 site and displayed 23% RPA. LUC6m, which is identical to LUC-6 except for the substitution of three nucleotides at the CRE-like site, displayed only 8.2% RPA, suggesting that the PS1-CRE element accounts for about two-thirds of the functional activity of this PS-1 promoter fragment. View larger version (23K): [in this window] [in a new window]  Fig. 3.  26-bp core element is critical for human presenilin-1 promoter activation. A, human presenilin-1 promoter-reporter constructs and their relative luciferase activity (%RLA) under unstimulated conditions. Of all the DNA fragments tested for promoter activity, plasmid LUC-3 with the human PS-1 fragment 297 to +189 showed the greatest ratio of firefly activity to Renilla internal control, which was defined as 100% of relative luciferase activity (100% RLA). B, phosphorylation of CREB at Ser-133 was induced with 100M NMDA in SK-N-SH cells. Western blots of cell lysates from SK-N-SH cells stimulated with 100M NMDA for the indicated time were probed with anti-CREB and anti-phospho-CREB (p-CREB) antibodies. C, transcription activity was induced with 100M NMDA in SK-N-SH cells. SK-N-SH cells were transiently transfected with CRE-SEAP plasmid (CLONTECH), which contains the SEAP reporter gene downstream of three copies of the CRE-binding sequence fused to a TATA-like promoter region from the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase promoter.

A similar, but nonidentical double-stranded oligonucleotide with a consensus sequence that binds CREB (CRE) was used as a positive control. The PS1-CRE sequence contains a TGACGACA element, the consensus CRE sequence contains a TGACGTCA element, and the PS1-CREm sequence contains a TGATAGCA element (Fig. 2A).

C, binding of nuclear proteins from NMDA-stimulated SK-N-SH cells to radiolabeled control CRE probe in an electrophoretic mobility shift assay. a and b, bands of CREB-CRE complex. ss, band that supershifted with anti-CREB monoclonal antibody. Anti--galactosidase polyclonal antibody was used as a control antibody, and no supershift was observed. Excess cold CRE probe inhibited the formation of CREB-CRE complex. D, binding of nuclear proteins from NMDA-stimulated SK-N-SH cells to radiolabeled PS1-CRE probe in an electrophoretic mobility shift assay. a and b, band of CREB-PS1-CRE complex. ss, band that supershifted with anti-CREB monoclonal antibody. Excess cold PS1-CRE probe inhibited the formation of CREB-CRE complex. Each of these elements was radiolabeled and used to probe the binding proteins present in nuclear extracts of cells. Radiolabeled CRE probe incubated with a nuclear extract from NMDA-stimulated SK-N-SH cells formed complexes that were observed on nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels as one strong band and one weaker band (Fig. 2B, bands a and b). To show that these complexes contain the CREB protein, anti-CREB monoclonal antibody was added to the reaction, and the observed band was supershifted to an apparently higher molecular weight (Fig. 2C, band ss). To show that the antibody reaction was specific for CREB protein, a control antibody (anti--gal) was added to the reaction, and no supershift band was observed (Fig. 2C, lane 4), indicating that the supershift effect of the anti-CREB antibody is specific for CRE/CREB-containing complexes. Using this assay, we then tested whether the CRE-like element present in the PS-1 promoter region could function to bind CREB proteins. Incubation of radiolabeled PS1-CRE probe with nuclear extracts revealed the same a and b bands that were observed when a consensus CRE probe was employed (Fig. 2B). When anti-CREB antibody was added to the PS1-CRE reaction, a supershifted band was observed (Fig. 2D, band ss), indicating that CREB is a component of this protein-PS1-CRE-probe complex as well. As another control, the addition of a molar excess of unlabeled PS1-CRE oligonucleotide probe to the nuclear extracts inhibited detection of this protein-PS1-CRE-probe complex (Fig. 2D, lane 4). The specificity of the complex formation between CREB proteins and PS1-CRE-probes was also tested using a mutated PS1-CRE probe. Incubation of radiolabeled PS1-CREm (mutated) probe with nuclear extracts did not reveal the a or b band (Fig. 2B, lane 4), suggesting that this putative CRE element in the PS-1 promoter is crucial for forming CREB-DNA complexes. CREB-responsive Element in the PS-1 Proximal Promoter Is Functional-- To test whether the PS1-CRE element identified in the proximal promoter could participate in transcriptional activity, we combined this element with a firefly luciferase reporter (Promega; pGL3-basic vector) to look for CREB-mediated activity in human SK-N-SH cells of neuronal origin. As an internal standard, we used the pRL-TK vector (Promega), which contains the Renilla luciferase gene driven by a herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase promoter. Of all of the DNA fragments tested for promoter activity, plasmid LUC-3 with the human PS-1 fragment 297 to +189 showed the greatest amount of firefly luciferase activity relative to the Renilla luciferase internal control. This ratio of LUC-3 activity to Renilla activity was defined as 100% of relative promoter activity (100% RPA) (Fig. 3A). Larger DNA fragments such as LUC-4 (1191 to +189) and LUC-5 (4311 to +189) displayed 84% and 25% of the LUC-3 activity (84% and 25% RPA). LUC-1 (297 to +1258) and LUC-2 (1191 to +1258) each displayed less than 10% RPA, suggesting that they contained negative elements that apparently reduce overall promoter activity. Although LUC-6 (18 to +8) was the shortest fragment tested, it contains a putative CREB binding site and a putative Elk-1 site and displayed 23% RPA. LUC6m, which is identical to LUC-6 except for the substitution of three nucleotides at the CRE-like site, displayed only 8.2% RPA, suggesting that the PS1-CRE element accounts for about two-thirds of the functional activity of this PS-1 promoter fragment. View larger version (23K): [in this window] [in a new window]  Fig. 3.  26-bp core element is critical for human presenilin-1 promoter activation. A, human presenilin-1 promoter-reporter constructs and their relative luciferase activity (%RLA) under unstimulated conditions. Of all the DNA fragments tested for promoter activity, plasmid LUC-3 with the human PS-1 fragment 297 to +189 showed the greatest ratio of firefly activity to Renilla internal control, which was defined as 100% of relative luciferase activity (100% RLA). B, phosphorylation of CREB at Ser-133 was induced with 100M NMDA in SK-N-SH cells. Western blots of cell lysates from SK-N-SH cells stimulated with 100M NMDA for the indicated time were probed with anti-CREB and anti-phospho-CREB (p-CREB) antibodies. C, transcription activity was induced with 100M NMDA in SK-N-SH cells. SK-N-SH cells were transiently transfected with CRE-SEAP plasmid (CLONTECH), which contains the SEAP reporter gene downstream of three copies of the CRE-binding sequence fused to a TATA-like promoter region from the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase promoter. Alkaline phosphatase activities in the media at the indicated times were measured using Great EscApe SEAP Chemiluminescence Detec tion Kit (CLONTECH). *, p<0.01compared with unstimulated control using Student's t test. D, NMDA-transactivated PS-1 promoters. SK-N-SH cells were transiently cotransfected with one of the human presenilin-1 promoter-reporter constructs and pRL-TK plasmid. Cells were cultured for 24h with (NMDA) or without 100M NMDA (Unstimulated), FL and RL activities were measured sequentially, and the RPA was calculated as follows: RPA=FL/RL. -Fold inductions are shown. Each value represents the average of at least four independent determinations, and the error bars indicate the S.E. **, p<0.01using Student's t test (n=3). E, MK801 inhibited the activation of PS-1 promoter by NMDA. The cells were preincubated with 100M MK801, a selective NMDA antagonist, prior to the addition of 100M NMDA. **, p<0.01using Student's t test (n=3) Since basal levels of activated CREB are rather low in these cells, we asked whether NMDA treatment of these cells would activate CREB by enhancing its phosphorylation at Ser-133, subsequently resulting in increased PS-1 expression. 15min after adding 100M NMDA, CREB was phosphorylated at Ser-133 and remained significantly phosphorylated for another 360min as shown on Western blots (Fig. 3B). We then tested whether phosphorylation of CREB led to increased transcriptional activity when CRE element-containing promoters were present. As a positive control, a CRE-SEAP reporter plasmid (CLONTECH), which contains three copies of a consensus CRE element fused to a TATA-like promoter from the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase promoter and a secreted alkaline phosphatase (SEAP) gene, was transfected into SK-N-SH neuroblastoma cells. NMDA treatment of these cells led to a dose- and time-dependent increase of extracellular phosphatase activity (Fig. 3C). These results suggest that NMDA treatment stimulates phosphorylation of CREB, which appears to function and increase CRE-mediated levels of SEAP activity. To test whether the PS1-CRE element would also respond to NMDA treatments that activate CREB, we returned to our luciferase activity system to measure functional responses.

Phrase: "-Fold inductions are shown. Each value represents the average of at least four independent determinations, and the error bars indicate the S.E. **, p<0.01using Student's t test (n=3). E, MK801 inhibited the activation of PS-1 promoter by NMDA. The cells were preincubated with 100M MK801, a selective NMDA antagonist, prior to the addition of 100M NMDA. **, p<0.01using Student's t test (n=3) Since basal levels of activated CREB are rather low in these cells, we asked whether NMDA treatment of these cells would activate CREB by enhancing its phosphorylation at Ser-133, subsequently resulting in increased PS-1 expression. 15min after adding 100M NMDA, CREB was phosphorylated at Ser-133 and remained significantly phosphorylated for another 360min as shown on Western blots (Fig. 3B). We then tested whether phosphorylation of CREB led to increased transcriptional activity when CRE element-containing promoters were present. As a positive control, a CRE-SEAP reporter plasmid (CLONTECH), which contains three copies of a consensus CRE element fused to a TATA-like promoter from the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase promoter and a secreted alkaline phosphatase (SEAP) gene, was transfected into SK-N-SH neuroblastoma cells. NMDA treatment of these cells led to a dose- and time-dependent increase of extracellular phosphatase activity (Fig. 3C). These results suggest that NMDA treatment stimulates phosphorylation of CREB, which appears to function and increase CRE-mediated levels of SEAP activity. To test whether the PS1-CRE element would also respond to NMDA treatments that activate CREB, we returned to our luciferase activity system to measure functional responses. NMDA treatment of SK-N-SH cells displayed 2.3-fold increase in LUC-3 (297 to +189) activity and 1.6-fold increase in LUC-4 (1191 to +189) activity compared with nonstimulated conditions (Fig. 3D). When LUC-6 (positions 18 to +8), the shortest PS-1 promoter fragment that contains a CRE element, was tested, NMDA treatment displayed a 3.7-fold increase in its activity compared with nonstimulated conditions. In contrast, the mutated CRE sequence in LUC-6m displayed similar RPA levels with or without NMDA treatment. On the other hand, NMDA treatments had no significant effect in cells transfected with LUC-1 (positions 297 to +1258), LUC-2 (positions 1191 to +1258), or LUC-5 (positions 4311 to +189) (Fig. 3D). As a control, cells were preincubated with the selective NMDA receptor antagonist, MK-801, and the subsequent effect of NMDA to induce PS-1 promoter-directed luciferase activity was significantly inhibited (Fig. 3E). These results suggest that the CRE element contained in the 26-bp fragment of the PS-1 promoter spanning positions 18 to +8 can bind phosphorylated CREB and activate transcription at the major transcription start site (position +1).

Phrase: "- To extend our finding that CREB activates PS-1 reporter gene expression, we also evaluated the ability of activated CREB to increase expression of the endogenous PS-1 gene products. Like the NMDA-dependent phosphorylation of CREB, NMDA dose-dependently increases the level of PS-1 mRNA in SK-N-SH neuroblastoma cells (Fig. 4). With respect to protein expression, we found that treatment of SK-N-SH cells with NMDA for 6h followed by a 1-h pulse label with [35S]methionine resulted in a dose-dependent increase of labeled PS-1 protein levels (Fig. 5A). In these experiments, full-length PS-1 (PS-1FL) was observed as a strong band at 45kDa, and the amino-terminal fragment of PS-1 (PS-1NTF) was observed as faint bands at 30kDa, suggesting that full-length PS-1 was detected before its cleavage into amino-terminal and C-terminal fragments (61, 62). PS-1 protein synthesis appears to start at 4h after NMDA treatment and lasts until 18h after the treatment (Fig. 5C). We could also detect several bands that migrated more slowly than the full-length monomeric PS-1 protein, suggesting that they were aggregated forms of PS-1 and/or its fragments (PS-1ag). View larger version (15K): [in this window] [in a new window]  Fig. 4.  Northern blot hybridization analysis. The SK-N-SH cells were cultured with the indicated concentration of NMDA for 6h, RNA was extracted from the cells, and PS-1 mRNA was quantified with Northern hybridization analysis. *, p<0.01using Student's t test (n=3). View larger version (47K): [in this window] [in a new window]  Fig. 5.  Metabolic labeling with [35S]Methionine Clarified the Induction of PS-1 by NMDA and BDNF in SK-N-SH cells. The horizontal arrows indicate aggregated PS-1 (PS-1ag), full-length PS-1 (PS-1FL), and amino-terminal fragment of PS-1 (PS-1NTF). A, NMDA induced PS-1, and both MK801 and nifedipine inhibited the induction. Confluent SK-N-SH cells were prepared in six-well dishes. Medium was changed to the methionine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 2% dialyzed fetal bovine serum and incubated for 1h. Then NMDA was added to the medium at the indicated concentration and incubated for 6h, followed by pulse labeling with 200Ci/ml [35S]methionine for 1h. The cells were lysed immediately, and immunoprecipitation with polyclonal antibody against N-terminal fragment of PS-1 was performed. Electrophoresis was performed with 10% Tris-glycine polyacrylamide gel. The gels were vacuum-dried and autoradiographed. For inhibition experiments, 100M MK801 or 20M nifedipine was added to the medium when the medium was changed. *, p<0.01compared with unstimulated control using Student's t test (n=3); **, p<0.01compared with each other using Student's t test (n=3). B, U0126-inhibited and dominant negative CREBs reduced PS-1 induction by NMDA. 10M U0126 was added to the culture medium when the medium was changed to the methionine-free one, or the cells were transfected with 50m.o.i. adenovirus bearing control LacZ cDNA or one of the dominant negative CREB cDNAs (CREB-M1 and K-CREB) 24h prior to change of the medium. C, time course experiments. 200Ci/ml [35S]methionine was added to the medium at the indicated time after 100M NMDA was added. D, induction of PS-1 by BDNF. SK-N-SH cells were cultured with the indicated concentration of BDNF for 6h, followed by pulse labeling with 200Ci/ml [35S]methionine for 1h. In cells preincubated with MK801, a selective antagonist of the NMDA receptor, or with nifedipine, a selective blocker of the L-type voltage dependent Ca2+ channel (LVDCC), the effect of NMDA treatment to increase PS-1 protein levels was inhibited. These inhibitor treatments support a specific and selective role for NMDA and calcium in stimulating PS-1 gene expression (Fig. 5A).

Phrase: "- To test whether CREB directly regulates endogenous human PS-1 expression, we used adenovirus vectors to express different dominant negative forms of CREB before NMDA treatments of neuroblastoma cells and then measured PS-1 expression levels. K-CREB has a mutation in the domain that binds to CRE elements in DNA (56), and CREB-M1 contains a serine 133to alanine mutation (S133A) that cannot be phosphorylated (58), both of which result in nonfunctional CREB proteins that fail to stimulate gene transcription. Overexpression of K-CREB or CREB-M1 dominant negative forms of CREB in SK-N-SH cells followed by NMDA treatment reduced the induction of PS-1 gene products, indicating that CREB activation is essential for NMDA induction of PS-1 gene expression (Fig. 5B).

Phrase: "1.6-fold increase in LUC-4 (1191 to +189) activity compared with nonstimulated conditions (Fig. 3D). When LUC-6 (positions 18 to +8), the shortest PS-1 promoter fragment that contains a CRE element, was tested, NMDA treatment displayed a 3.7-fold increase in its activity compared with nonstimulated conditions. In contrast, the mutated CRE sequence in LUC-6m displayed similar RPA levels with or without NMDA treatment. On the other hand, NMDA treatments had no significant effect in cells transfected with LUC-1 (positions 297 to +1258), LUC-2 (positions 1191 to +1258), or LUC-5 (positions 4311 to +189) (Fig. 3D). As a control, cells were preincubated with the selective NMDA receptor antagonist, MK-801, and the subsequent effect of NMDA to induce PS-1 promoter-directed luciferase activity was significantly inhibited (Fig. 3E). These results suggest that the CRE element contained in the 26-bp fragment of the PS-1 promoter spanning positions 18 to +8 can bind phosphorylated CREB and activate transcription at the major transcription start site (position +1). NMDA Treatment Induces PS-1 Gene Expression-- To extend our finding that CREB activates PS-1 reporter gene expression, we also evaluated the ability of activated CREB to increase expression of the endogenous PS-1 gene products. Like the NMDA-dependent phosphorylation of CREB, NMDA dose-dependently increases the level of PS-1 mRNA in SK-N-SH neuroblastoma cells (Fig. 4). With respect to protein expression, we found that treatment of SK-N-SH cells with NMDA for 6h followed by a 1-h pulse label with [35S]methionine resulted in a dose-dependent increase of labeled PS-1 protein levels (Fig. 5A). In these experiments, full-length PS-1 (PS-1FL) was observed as a strong band at 45kDa, and the amino-terminal fragment of PS-1 (PS-1NTF) was observed as faint bands at 30kDa, suggesting that full-length PS-1 was detected before its cleavage into amino-terminal and C-terminal fragments (61, 62). PS-1 protein synthesis appears to start at 4h after NMDA treatment and lasts until 18h after the treatment (Fig. 5C). We could also detect several bands that migrated more slowly than the full-length monomeric PS-1 protein, suggesting that they were aggregated forms of PS-1 and/or its fragments (PS-1ag).

The horizontal arrows indicate aggregated PS-1 (PS-1ag), full-length PS-1 (PS-1FL), and amino-terminal fragment of PS-1 (PS-1NTF). A, NMDA induced PS-1, and both MK801 and nifedipine inhibited the induction. Confluent SK-N-SH cells were prepared in six-well dishes. Medium was changed to the methionine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 2% dialyzed fetal bovine serum and incubated for 1h. Then NMDA was added to the medium at the indicated concentration and incubated for 6h, followed by pulse labeling with 200Ci/ml [35S]methionine for 1h. The cells were lysed immediately, and immunoprecipitation with polyclonal antibody against N-terminal fragment of PS-1 was performed. Electrophoresis was performed with 10% Tris-glycine polyacrylamide gel. The gels were vacuum-dried and autoradiographed. For inhibition experiments, 100M MK801 or 20M nifedipine was added to the medium when the medium was changed. *, p<0.01compared with unstimulated control using Student's t test (n=3); **, p<0.01compared with each other using Student's t test (n=3). B, U0126-inhibited and dominant negative CREBs reduced PS-1 induction by NMDA. 10M U0126 was added to the culture medium when the medium was changed to the methionine-free one, or the cells were transfected with 50m.o.i. adenovirus bearing control LacZ cDNA or one of the dominant negative CREB cDNAs (CREB-M1 and K-CREB) 24h prior to change of the medium. C, time course experiments. 200Ci/ml [35S]methionine was added to the medium at the indicated time after 100M NMDA was added. D, induction of PS-1 by BDNF. SK-N-SH cells were cultured with the indicated concentration of BDNF for 6h, followed by pulse labeling with 200Ci/ml [35S]methionine for 1h. In cells preincubated with MK801, a selective antagonist of the NMDA receptor, or with nifedipine, a selective blocker of the L-type voltage dependent Ca2+ channel (LVDCC), the effect of NMDA treatment to increase PS-1 protein levels was inhibited. These inhibitor treatments support a specific and selective role for NMDA and calcium in stimulating PS-1 gene expression (Fig. 5A). Since NMDA receptor activation can lead to signal transduction mediated through the MEK kinase, then inhibition of MEK kinase activity may modulate PS-1 expression. Preincubation with 10M U0126, a selective MEK inhibitor (63), reduced PS-1 induction, suggesting that this kinase activity was necessary for PS-1 induction at the protein level (Fig. 5B). Relationship of NMDA and CREB to PS-1 Induction-- To test whether CREB directly regulates endogenous human PS-1 expression, we used adenovirus vectors to express different dominant negative forms of CREB before NMDA treatments of neuroblastoma cells and then measured PS-1 expression levels. K-CREB has a mutation in the domain that binds to CRE elements in DNA (56), and CREB-M1 contains a serine 133to alanine mutation (S133A) that cannot be phosphorylated (58), both of which result in nonfunctional CREB proteins that fail to stimulate gene transcription. Overexpression of K-CREB or CREB-M1 dominant negative forms of CREB in SK-N-SH cells followed by NMDA treatment reduced the induction of PS-1 gene products, indicating that CREB activation is essential for NMDA induction of PS-1 gene expression (Fig. 5B). As a control, adenovirus expressing the lacZ gene product, -galactosidase, did not affect NMDA-mediated increases in PS-1 gene expression. BDNF Induces PS-1 Expression-- BDNF was also reported to stimulate phosphorylation at Ser-133, thereby activating CREB (64). Unlike NMDA treatments, BDNF application does not stimulate influx of Ca2+ from outside of the cell, but it does cause a slow intracellular Ca2+ rise that is probably from an internal Ca2+ store (64). Therefore, we used BDNF to activate CREB to understand whether the influx of extracellular Ca2+ from activated NMDA receptors or from L-type voltage-dependent Ca2+ channel is essential for the induction of PS-1. BDNF treatment of neuroblastoma cells for 6h resulted in a dose-dependent induction of PS-1 expression (Fig. 5D). Human PS-1 and Rat PS-1 Are Regulated by Phosphorylation of CREB-- Through the action of one or more kinases, phosphorylation at Ser-133 is a key step in CREB activation leading to induction of gene transcription. The mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase, MEK, apparently contributes to CREB activation, because preincubation with 10M U0126, a selective MEK inhibitor, reduced the induction of PS-1 by NMDA in SK-N-SH cells. On the other side of the coin, adenovirus-mediated overexpression of constitutively active MEK (54) in SK-N-SH cells dose-dependently induced PS-1 gene expression, while control adenovirus expressing -galactosidase did not change PS-1 gene expression levels (Fig. 6A). Like endogenous kinase, the MEK-mediated induction of PS-1 protein expression was reduced by treatment with the U0126 kinase inhibitor (Fig. 6B) and was reduced by adenovirus-mediated expression of dominant negative CREBs (Fig. 6C). Adenovirus-mediated expression of MEK leading to increased PS-1 expression was not inhibited by MK801 treatment as might be expected, since NMDA receptor activation is upstream of MEK in this signal transduction pathway (Fig. 6B). In a parallel experiment where rat primary hippocampal neurons were transfected with an adenoviral vector expressing constitutively active MEK, endogenous rat PS-1 expression was also induced (Fig. 6D). The induction of PS-1 in these primary rat neuronal cultures was fully inhibited by adenovirus-mediated expression of dominant negative CREBs and the U0126 MEK inhibitor, since it was also reduced in human SK-N-SH cells, suggesting the conservation of CREB binding sites in the rat PS-1 promoter (Fig. 6, D and E).

DISCUSSION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES Like the amyloid peptide precursor gene, PS-1 is associated with Alzheimer's disease. Except for rare families with mutations, the majority of Alzheimer's disease patients express both of these genes and their normal protein products in a wide variety of cells throughout the body (8, 27). This distribution raises the question as to how PS-1 appears to participate in a disease that primarily affects only the brain. Our studies (30) and those of others (29, 34) show that PS-1 is differentially distributed throughout the human brain. PS-1 is highly expressed in hippocampal pyramidal neurons, dentate granule neurons, and cerebellar Purkinje neurons, while other cortical regions display lower immunoreactivity. To understand this distribution, we began by examining the transcriptional regulation of the human PS-1 gene to look for other factors that control PS-1 and other genes of potential interest in Alzheimer's disease. Human PS-1 has two independent transcription start sites that are distinguished by position and activity (Ref. 60 and this report). Our initial screening of a Marathon-ready human brain cDNA library (CLONTECH) yielded several human PS-1 cDNA clones whose 5' terminus was actually upstream of the major transcription start site reported by Rogaev et al. at that time (60).3 We performed primer extension with an antisense primer (5'-AGCCGCTGTTTTGTTTCC-3', Fig. 1C) and total cellular RNA from SK-N-SH cells and found the major transcription start site that is located 26bp upstream of the reported start site (60). Pastorcic et al. (65) confirmed this new location of the major transcription start site of PS-1. Similar to our work with the mouse PS-1 gene, we also identified a minor transcription start site some 343bp downstream of the major transcription start site. Thus, the majority of the transcripts include exon 1,which is spliced to exon 3,and a minority of transcripts lack exon 1and include exon 2spliced to exon 3.Although the 5'-ends of the transcripts are different, the encoded PS-1 proteins are the same, since the translation starts from the ATG codon in exon 3(Fig. 1A). In the human PS-1 promoter sequence (GenBankTM accession number AF029701), several DNA elements of interest are found that probably control PS-1 gene expression at the transcriptional level. Four Alu repeats, the size of which varies from 178to 267bp, were identified, suggesting to us that the majority of the active elements in the PS-1 promoter were located between the Alu repeat ending at 812 and the major transcription start site (Fig. 1). Several putative transcription factor binding sites were identified in this region including one Lyf-1 site, two CdxA sites, one AML-1a site, one Nkx-2 site, one Pbx-1 site, one E47 site, one MZF1 site, two Sp1 sites, one Elk-1 site, and one CREB site. Among these transcription factor binding sites is a CREB binding site, which overlaps with the putative Elk-1 binding site. To prove our hypothesis that CREB activation controls PS-1 gene expression, which may participate in synaptic function, we closely examined the relationship between CREB and PS-1. The cAMP response element binding protein must be present and must be activated to bind to CRE elements within the promoter and stimulate PS-1 transcription. Using immunocytochemistry, we found that CREB and PS-1 are similarly distributed in the rat hippocampus and dentate gyrus, being particularly abundant in pyramidal neurons of the hippocampus and granule neurons of dentate gyrus (data not shown). CREB that actively binds its DNA element, CRE, is typically phosphorylated on serine at position 133.We found that the distribution of phosphorylated CREB was also similar to PS-1. As others have reported, the presence of phosphorylated CREB is usually associated with the products of genes that respond to CREB, such as c-Fos, Bcl-2, and BDNF (45-48). Activation of CREB by its phosphorylation at serine residue 133is modulated by a variety of effectors. NMDA receptors associated with synapses are involved in neuronal functions like long term potentiation (44). Stimulation of NMDA receptors has also been associated with increased calcium influx into cells, potentiation of kinase activities, and CREB activation. Like hippocampal neurons, the SK-N-SH neuronal cell line expresses functional NMDA receptors (66). Using electrophoretic mobility shift assay, we showed that CREB binds to the human PS-1 proximal promoter. When SK-N-SH cells were stimulated with 10or 100M NMDA, transcription from the human PS-1 gene was dose-dependently induced as shown by promoter-luciferase reporter assay (Fig. 3, D and E), Northern blotting (Fig. 4), and metabolic pulse labeling with [35S]methionine to detect PS-1 proteins (Fig. 5A). We detected full-length PS-1, the amino-terminal fragment of PS-1, and aggregated PS-1 proteins, which is consistent with previous reports showing that PS-1 was cleaved with an average half-life of 50min after pulse labeling (67). In these experiments, most of the labeled PS-1 protein detected was full-length PS-1, so little amino-terminal fragment of PS-1 was observed. This is because we employed 1-h pulse labeling,"

Phrase: "(69). When glutamate is released from the presynaptic membrane of glutaminergic neurons, NMDA receptors open and cause Ca2+ influx into postsynaptic spines, resulting in depolarization that triggers the opening of LVDCCS. The activation of LVDCCs, which open during strongly depolarizing conditions, permits the entry of a larger amount of Ca2+ along the dendrites and into the cell bodies.

Phrase: "(45), resulting in PS-1 induction. Our finding that preincubation with nifedipine almost completely inhibited the PS-1 induction stimulated by NMDA treatment suggests that the relevant Ca2+ comes through LVDCC, not the NMDA receptor channel. The importance of calcium influx, however, is not clear, since overexpression of constitutively active MEK does stimulate CREB activation and PS-1 expression, and preoverexpression of dominant negative CREBs reduced the PS-1 induction by constitutively active MEK while failing to stimulate calcium influx. We have shown by molecular and cell biological methods that the activation of the NMDA receptor-CREB pathway regulates PS-1 transcription. Considering that synaptic plasticity of hippocampal neurons is also associated with the activation of the CREB pathway, then the regulation of PS-1 itself may be associated with synaptic plasticity and long term memory.

Phrase: "1-h pulse labeling, which appeared to be shorter than the half-life of PS-1 protein, and full-length PS-1 was detected before its cleavage into amino-terminal and C-terminal fragments. Another cause of the lack of PS-1 amino-terminal fragment observed is that we used several kinds of protease inhibitors after lysing the cells as described under ""Experimental Procedures,"" such as phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, aprotinin, pepstatin, and leupeptin. Preincubation with MK801, an antagonist of the NMDA receptor, and with nifedipine, an inhibitor of L-type voltage-dependent calcium channels, inhibited the induction of PS-1, suggesting that the Ca2+ influx contributes to PS-1 gene induction (Fig. 5, A and B). Interestingly, BDNF is also known to phosphorylate CREB at Ser-133 without the participation of NMDA receptors (64). Even in the absence of NMDA, BDNF dose-dependently induces the transcription from PS-1 gene (Fig. 5D). As a whole, these data support our hypothesis that activation of CREB results in increased PS-1 gene expression. To directly elucidate the effect of CREB on PS-1 gene expression, we used two adenoviruses expressing dominant negative CREB cDNAs. As a control, an adenovirus expressing LacZ cDNA was used. CREB-M1, in which Ser-133 is converted to an alanine and cannot be phosphorylated or activated, was expressed in neuroblastoma cells and reduced the expression of PS-1. K-CREB with a mutation in the DNA binding domain was expressed in neuroblastoma cells and reduced the expression of PS-1, while control LacZ did not affect the expression (Fig. 5B). These data directly indicate that phosphorylation of CREB and its binding to the CRE element in the PS-1 promoter are required for induction of PS-1. MEK has also been reported to activate extracellular signal-regulated kinases that can phosphorylate proteins such as CREB, resulting in PS-1 induction. MEK phosphorylates extracellular signal-regulated kinases, and these activated extracellular signal-regulated kinases phosphorylate CREB (68). To verify whether MEK can stimulate PS-1 expression, we overexpressed a constitutively active MEK by adenoviral transduction and observed the dose-dependent induction of full-length PS-1 protein, while control LacZ adenovirus did not induce PS-1 (Fig. 6A). The MEK inhibitor U0126 not only inhibited MEK activity, as reported previously (63), but also inhibited PS-1 expression induced by the constitutively active MEK (Fig. 6B). It was also decreased by preoverexpression of either of the dominant negative CREBs, making it clearer that CREB phosphorylation is critical for the induction of PS-1 (Fig. 6C). The discrepancy between the effects of the MEK inhibitor and the dominant negative CREBs in blocking PS-1 induction in SK-N-SH cells by the constitutively active MEK could be due to participation of the transcription factor Elk-1, because MEK can stimulate not only CREB but also Elk-1, and Elk-1 can up-regulate PS-1 transcription as previously described (65). While dominant negative CREBs only partially inhibited the induction of PS-1 by constitutively active MEK in SK-N-SH cells, they fully inhibited the induction of PS-1 in rat hippocampal neurons. (Fig. 6, D and E). This could potentially be due to differences in the organization of the PS-1 promoter between rat and human, although we do not know the exact sequence of the rat PS-1 promoter. CREB activation is associated with acquisition of learning and memory, which can be demonstrated in the hippocampus (8, 22). Among other types, glutaminergic neurons in the hippocampus display abundant numbers of dendritic spines, and their synapses are rich in NMDA receptors. The activation of NMDA receptors leads to CREB phosphorylation and Ca2+ influx into these postsynaptic spines, which is critical for maintenance of synaptic plasticity and ultimately synaptic transmission (69). When glutamate is released from the presynaptic membrane of glutaminergic neurons, NMDA receptors open and cause Ca2+ influx into postsynaptic spines, resulting in depolarization that triggers the opening of LVDCCS. The activation of LVDCCs, which open during strongly depolarizing conditions, permits the entry of a larger amount of Ca2+ along the dendrites and into the cell bodies. This calcium influx can activate kinases such as extracellular signal-regulated kinase and calmodulin kinase II that function to phosphorylate CREB (45), resulting in PS-1 induction. Our finding that preincubation with nifedipine almost completely inhibited the PS-1 induction stimulated by NMDA treatment suggests that the relevant Ca2+ comes through LVDCC, not the NMDA receptor channel. The importance of calcium influx, however, is not clear, since overexpression of constitutively active MEK does stimulate CREB activation and PS-1 expression, and preoverexpression of dominant negative CREBs reduced the PS-1 induction by constitutively active MEK while failing to stimulate calcium influx. We have shown by molecular and cell biological methods that the activation of the NMDA receptor-CREB pathway regulates PS-1 transcription. Considering that synaptic plasticity of hippocampal neurons is also associated with the activation of the CREB pathway, then the regulation of PS-1 itself may be associated with synaptic plasticity and long term memory.
