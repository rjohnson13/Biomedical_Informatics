Phrase: "(Fig. 3B). Pattern of the purified -synuclein cleaved by the cMMP-3 was the same as those by MMP-3. Thus, the hemopexin-like domain of MMP-3 has no effect on the cleavage of -synuclein. To estimate cleavage efficiency by MMP-3, we compared MMP-3-dependent degradation of -synuclein with that of apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I). ApoA-I, a major protein component of high density lipoprotein, is known to be cleaved very efficiently by MMP-3, moderately by MMP-7 and MMP-12, and slightly by MMP-1, but not by MMP-9 (53"

Processing 00000000.tx.191: -synuclein was cleaved by MMP-3 and cMMP-3 as described above, and their cleavage patterns were compared. 

Phrase: "--synuclein IgG.  Following the transient transfection of SK-N-BE cells with the plasmid encoding -synuclein, the addition of SIN-1 resulted in an increase in the extracellular-secreted -synuclein levels, as compared with the -synuclein-transfected and vehicle-treated control cells. Interestingly, the treatment with SIN-1 at a concentration of 100 M generated a partially digested fragment of -synuclein having a size of 6.5 kDa, suggesting that the processing of -synuclein could be brought about via the intracellular generation of nitric oxide (Fig. 2B). When other NO donors, such as sodium nitroprusside or S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine, were present during the pretreatment, a similar cleavage pattern of intact -synuclein was observed in the SK-N-BE cells (Fig. 2C, S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine data is not shown). MMPs are implicated in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases and stroke (34, 35). Moreover, the recent finding that S-nitrosylation activates MMP-9, subsequently leading to neuronal apoptosis, strongly implicated the involvement of a potential extracellular proteolysis pathway in the observed neuronal cell death, in which S-nitrosylation activates the MMPs. To confirm the involvement of MMPs in the NO-induced extracellular degradation of -synuclein, the cells were pretreated with a potent inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase, N-hydroxy-1,3-di-(4-methoxybenzenesulfonyl)-5,5-dimethyl-(1,3)-piperazine-2-carboxamide (also known as MMP inhibitor II), treated with SIN-1, and then the processing of -synuclein was assessed. MMP inhibitor II is reported to inhibit MMP-1, -3, -7, and -9 with an IC50 range of 230 nM. As shown in Fig. 2B, pretreatment with this MMP inhibitor completely blocked the cleavage of -synuclein, indicating that some MMPs play an active role during the NO-induced processing of -synuclein in SK-N-BE cells. Cleavage of -Synuclein with Various MMPs in VitroAs shown in Fig. 3A, the purified -synuclein was cleaved by the tested MMPs to some extents. Referring the amount of the intact form, the purified -synuclein was cleaved by MMP-3 most efficiently, and then in the order of MMP-14, MMP-2, MMP-1, and MMP-9. To test effect of hemopexin-like domain of MMP-3 in the cleavage of -synuclein, the susceptibility of -synuclein to the activated MMP-3 and the cMMP-3 that lacks its hemopexin-like domain was compared (Fig. 3B). Pattern of the purified -synuclein cleaved by the cMMP-3 was the same as those by MMP-3. Thus, the hemopexin-like domain of MMP-3 has no effect on the cleavage of -synuclein. To estimate cleavage efficiency by MMP-3, we compared MMP-3-dependent degradation of -synuclein with that of apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I). ApoA-I, a major protein component of high density lipoprotein, is known to be cleaved very efficiently by MMP-3, moderately by MMP-7 and MMP-12, and slightly by MMP-1, but not by MMP-9 (53). When -synuclein and apoA-I were digested by cMMP-3 at the same condition, their intact forms were disappeared at similar levels (Fig. 3, C and D). Thus, we confirmed that -synuclein is a substrate for MMP-3 as efficiently as apoA-I. Determination of Cleavage Sites of -Synuclein by MMP-3To examine the patterns of -synuclein degradation, the purified -synuclein was incubated for 0-180 min with the catalytic domain of cMMP-3 at a 1:0.02 substrate/enzyme molar ratio. Upon incubation of -synuclein with cMMP-3, we detected three light fragments (A, B, and C bands) and dark doublet fragments (D and E bands) at earlier time points, and two dark fragments (F and G bands) later (Fig. 4A). The N-terminal sequences of the four major fragments of -synuclein (D, E, F, and G bands) were determined to be Met1-Asp-Val-Phe-Met. The intact form of -synuclein was completely degraded at 180-min incubation with the catalytic domain of MMP-3 (Fig. 4A). Fig. 4B shows the MALDI-TOF mass spectra of the cMMP-3-cleaved bands of -synuclein at time points of 0-180 min. Although the calculated molecular mass of intact -synuclein was 14460.2 Da, its observed mass value was 14463.3  2.4 Da for [M+H]+ (single asterisks in Fig. 4B) and 7232.6  1.1 Da for [M+2H]2+/2 (double asterisks in Fig. 4B). Four major peaks, m/z 7929.4  3.5, 7804.2  2.0, 5796.9  2.5, and 5496.7  1.2, which were detected in reproducible positions, were assigned as the residues Met1-Gln79, Met1-Ala78, Met1-Glu57, and Met1-Thr54 (Fig. 4, B and C), respectively. Comparing intensities and relative locations of bands (Fig. 4A), along with their N-terminal sequences, with intensities and molecular masses of the peaks (Fig. 4B), we noticed that the four major peaks correspond to the D, E, F, and G fragments on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 4A), respectively. In addition, three minor peaks, m/z 10193.6  3.6, 9143.0  2.3, and 8987.2  5.7, had possible assignments of the residues Met1-Lys102, Met1-Gly93, and Met1-Ala91 (Fig. 4, B and C), corresponding to the A, B, and C fragments on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 4A), respectively. Moreover, two peaks of m/z 6677.6  2.7 and 6552.2  0.6 were assigned as the residues Lys80-Ala140 and Gln79-Ala140, which correspond to the m/z values of counterpart fragments for D and E fragments (D' and E'), respectively (Fig. 4, B and C). Therefore, -synuclein was gradually broken down by MMP-3 from its C-terminal end. It is interesting to note that MMP-3 has at least four different cleavage sites, Ala78Gln79, Gln79Lys80, Ala91Thr92, Gly93Phe94, within the non-amyloid plaque sequence (Glu61-Val95) of -synuclein. In this regard, it is likely that MMP-3 would have an effect on the aggregation of -synuclein. View larger version (71K): [in this window] [in a new window]  FIG. 3.

However, no synergistic increase in the mRNA or protein levels of MMP-3 was observed in those cells treated with -synuclein plus SIN-1. In a similar way, the intracellular production of nitric oxide resulted in the production of MMP-3 proteins. Taken together, these findings suggest that the overexpression of -synuclein resulted in the activation of MMP-3, as well as changes in its mRNA and protein levels, and its effect appeared to be mediated by the generation of intracellular nitrating compounds in neuronal SK-N-BE cells.

Processing 00000000.tx.225: -Synuclein (1 g) was digested by cMMP-3 in a 1:0.02 substrate/enzyme molar ratio at 37 C. 

Phrase: "-synuclein was cleaved by MMP-3 and cMMP-3 as described above, and their cleavage patterns were compared. C and D, cleavage of -synuclein and apoA-I by MMP-3 in a dosage-dependent manner in vitro. -Synuclein (1 g; C) and apolipoprotein A-I (1 g; D) were digested by cMMP-3 in a dosage-dependent manner (1:0, 1:0.01, 1:0.02, 1:0.04 substrate/enzyme molar ratio) for 120 min at 37 C. Samples were analyzed on 15% Tris-Tricine gel (C) and 15% Tris-glycine gel (D).  Overexpression of -Synuclein Results in the Up-regulation of MMP-3 Levels in SK-N-BE CellsWe investigated whether the overexpression of -synuclein affects the endogenous levels of MMP-3 inside SK-N-BE cells. As shown in Fig. 5A, RT-PCR analysis showed that the mRNA levels of MMP-3 were significantly affected by the transient transfection of -synuclein, as compared with those in mock-transfected control cells. Furthermore, Western blot analysis showed that the active and cleaved 45-kDa form of MMP-3 was also significantly produced by -synuclein (Fig. 5B). Based on the report that nitrite-generating NO stimuli might influence the expression of MMPs (23), we investigated whether the addition of an NO donor affects the levels of expression of MMP-3 induced by -synuclein transfection. As shown in Fig. 5C, the addition of an NO donor (SIN-1) alone resulted in the induction of MMP-3 expression, as determined by RT-PCR and Western blot analysis, respectively. However, no synergistic increase in the mRNA or protein levels of MMP-3 was observed in those cells treated with -synuclein plus SIN-1. In a similar way, the intracellular production of nitric oxide resulted in the production of MMP-3 proteins. Taken together, these findings suggest that the overexpression of -synuclein resulted in the activation of MMP-3, as well as changes in its mRNA and protein levels, and its effect appeared to be mediated by the generation of intracellular nitrating compounds in neuronal SK-N-BE cells. Consistent with this observation, we previously reported that the expression of -synuclein causes the formation of reactive oxygen species in hippocampal neuronal cells (28). The Kinetics and Neurotoxicity Induced by Intact -Synuclein Inclusions Are Different From Those Observed in the Presence of MMP-3-cleaved FragmentsProtein aggregation of -synuclein in the presence and absence of the MMP-digested -synuclein fragments was evaluated by measuring the turbidity. The -synuclein fragments, which were produced by MMP-3 (Fig. 6A, inset), exhibited most dramatic stimulation, whereas the aggregation observed only with the intact protein was slowly progressed to lesser extents (Fig. 6A). When the thioflavin-T binding fluorescence was simultaneously evaluated, the difference on the amyloid formations of -synuclein in the presence and absence of the proteolyzed fragments by MMP-3 was narrowed, as compared with the turbidity (Fig. 6B). When the cytotoxicity of the protein aggregates by intact -synuclein was compared with those prepared with MMP-3-mediated digestion fragments, the aggregates following MMP-3 treatment had a more toxic effect on the cell viability (Fig. 6C). The formation of fibrous and granular structures during the -synuclein aggregation in the presence and absence of the digested fragments generated by MMP-3 was morphologically analyzed with a transmission electron microscope. As shown in Fig. 6D, the structures of the final protein aggregates are clearly distinctive from each other. The intact -synuclein aggregates contained only the fibrillar forms, whereas the inclusions obtained with the MMP-3-digested -synuclein showed the spherical granular forms in addition to the fibrillar aggregates. Lansbury et al. demonstrated that in vitro fibril formation by -synuclein from its soluble monomeric form does not follow a simple one-step transition, but rather a complex process that involves one or more discrete intermediates, termed protofibrils (26, 27). During the process, a protofibril intermediate, rather than the fibril itself, may be thought to be more pathogenic. They have also characterized several -synuclein oligomers, which are much smaller than fibrils and appear early in the fibrillization process as granular forms (26, 27). In consistent with this view, the morphological difference between the two protein aggregations has been reflected by the distinct patterns of aggregation kinetics and the neurotoxicities of the two final inclusions. An Increase in MMP-3 Levels in the Substantia Nigra Region of the 6-OHDA-injected Rat BrainSeveral studies have shown that a unilateral decrease in activity in the nigrostriatal dopamine system causes asymmetry in the movements and posture of animals. The symptoms may range from unilateral hypokinesia to vigorous rotation toward one side. The unilateral lesioning of the nigrostriatal dopamine system in rats, induced by the intrastriatal injection of 6-OHDA, which produces an almost complete and selective lesion, is recommended for studies of different functional states in the nigrostriatal dopamine system (36).

Phrase: "-Synuclein (1 g; C) and apolipoprotein A-I (1 g; D) were digested by cMMP-3 in a dosage-dependent manner (1:0, 1:0.01, 1:0.02, 1:0.04 substrate/enzyme molar ratio) for 120 min at 37 C. Samples were analyzed on 15% Tris-Tricine gel (C) and 15% Tris-glycine gel (D).  Overexpression of -Synuclein Results in the Up-regulation of MMP-3 Levels in SK-N-BE CellsWe investigated whether the overexpression of -synuclein affects the endogenous levels of MMP-3 inside SK-N-BE cells. As shown in Fig. 5A, RT-PCR analysis showed that the mRNA levels of MMP-3 were significantly affected by the transient transfection of -synuclein, as compared with those in mock-transfected control cells. Furthermore, Western blot analysis showed that the active and cleaved 45-kDa form of MMP-3 was also significantly produced by -synuclein (Fig. 5B). Based on the report that nitrite-generating NO stimuli might influence the expression of MMPs (23), we investigated whether the addition of an NO donor affects the levels of expression of MMP-3 induced by -synuclein transfection. As shown in Fig. 5C, the addition of an NO donor (SIN-1) alone resulted in the induction of MMP-3 expression, as determined by RT-PCR and Western blot analysis, respectively. However, no synergistic increase in the mRNA or protein levels of MMP-3 was observed in those cells treated with -synuclein plus SIN-1. In a similar way, the intracellular production of nitric oxide resulted in the production of MMP-3 proteins. Taken together, these findings suggest that the overexpression of -synuclein resulted in the activation of MMP-3, as well as changes in its mRNA and protein levels, and its effect appeared to be mediated by the generation of intracellular nitrating compounds in neuronal SK-N-BE cells. Consistent with this observation, we previously reported that the expression of -synuclein causes the formation of reactive oxygen species in hippocampal neuronal cells (28). The Kinetics and Neurotoxicity Induced by Intact -Synuclein Inclusions Are Different From Those Observed in the Presence of MMP-3-cleaved FragmentsProtein aggregation of -synuclein in the presence and absence of the MMP-digested -synuclein fragments was evaluated by measuring the turbidity. The -synuclein fragments, which were produced by MMP-3 (Fig. 6A, inset), exhibited most dramatic stimulation, whereas the aggregation observed only with the intact protein was slowly progressed to lesser extents (Fig. 6A). When the thioflavin-T binding fluorescence was simultaneously evaluated, the difference on the amyloid formations of -synuclein in the presence and absence of the proteolyzed fragments by MMP-3 was narrowed, as compared with the turbidity (Fig. 6B). When the cytotoxicity of the protein aggregates by intact -synuclein was compared with those prepared with MMP-3-mediated digestion fragments, the aggregates following MMP-3 treatment had a more toxic effect on the cell viability (Fig. 6C). The formation of fibrous and granular structures during the -synuclein aggregation in the presence and absence of the digested fragments generated by MMP-3 was morphologically analyzed with a transmission electron microscope. As shown in Fig. 6D, the structures of the final protein aggregates are clearly distinctive from each other. The intact -synuclein aggregates contained only the fibrillar forms, whereas the inclusions obtained with the MMP-3-digested -synuclein showed the spherical granular forms in addition to the fibrillar aggregates. Lansbury et al. demonstrated that in vitro fibril formation by -synuclein from its soluble monomeric form does not follow a simple one-step transition, but rather a complex process that involves one or more discrete intermediates, termed protofibrils (26, 27). During the process, a protofibril intermediate, rather than the fibril itself, may be thought to be more pathogenic. They have also characterized several -synuclein oligomers, which are much smaller than fibrils and appear early in the fibrillization process as granular forms (26, 27). In consistent with this view, the morphological difference between the two protein aggregations has been reflected by the distinct patterns of aggregation kinetics and the neurotoxicities of the two final inclusions. An Increase in MMP-3 Levels in the Substantia Nigra Region of the 6-OHDA-injected Rat BrainSeveral studies have shown that a unilateral decrease in activity in the nigrostriatal dopamine system causes asymmetry in the movements and posture of animals. The symptoms may range from unilateral hypokinesia to vigorous rotation toward one side. The unilateral lesioning of the nigrostriatal dopamine system in rats, induced by the intrastriatal injection of 6-OHDA, which produces an almost complete and selective lesion, is recommended for studies of different functional states in the nigrostriatal dopamine system (36).

Processing 00000000.tx.268: To assess the possibility of the extracellular localization of -synuclein in vivo, we analyzed the localization of -synuclein in the mouse brain using electron microscopy.2 We found that -synuclein is primarily localized in the presynaptic nerve terminals, whereas a moderate intensity of -synuclein immunoreactivity is present in the cytoplasm and nucleoplasm of the cerebral cortical neurons, as well as the plasma membrane, ribosomes, rough endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondria, small vesicles and nuclear outer membrane.2 Interestingly, however, -synuclein immunoreactivity is also associated with the postsynaptic areas and synaptic clefts,2 which supports the current observation of -synuclein immunoreactivity in SK-N-BE cells, tending to implicate the extracellular localization of -synuclein.

Processing 00000000.tx.270: -Synuclein is cleaved most effectively in vitro by MMP-3, generating an 6.5-kDa major fragment, whereas it could be digested in some extents by MMP-14, MMP-2, MMP-1, and MMP-9. 

Phrase: "--synuclein immunostaining was co-localized with synaptophysin-immunoreactive presynaptic terminals as well as synaptic vesicles in the rat brain, suggesting that -synuclein is a presynaptic protein (24, 37). In the present study, we observed that, when the -synuclein is transiently expressed in dopaminergic neuroblastoma SK-N-BE cells, it is secreted into extracellular space. When the bacterial recombinant -synuclein protein was added to the culture medium, it was found to be transported into the intracellular cytoplasm, resulting in necrotic cell death in H19-7 cells (28). Based on these two findings, we speculate that -synuclein has the capability to pass through the membrane as well as the binding to the membrane, and, as a result of this novel property, -synuclein is localized in the synaptic cleft and postsynaptic densities, as well as in the presynaptic terminals. Although the protein was originally found to be located in the presynaptic terminals, and was thought to play a role in neuronal plasticity (24), a certain amount of evidence has emerged, which suggests that the full-length -synuclein as well as its digested fragment plays a functional role in non-cytoplasmic locations, such as the nucleus and extracellular space. Firstly, whereas classic brainstem LBs appear as intracytoplasmic circular inclusions, LBs can extend into nerve cell processes or lie free in the neuropil, referred to as ""extracellular Lewy bodies"" (38). Secondly, the fragment (residues 61-95) of -synuclein defined as the ""non-amyloid component (NAC) of senile plaques"" was found to be associated with extracellular A deposits in the AD patient's brain (24, 42). Although NAC is tightly associated with A fibrils in the AD amyloid, -synuclein has also been shown to bind A (43) as well as amyloid plaques in the AD brain (44). Thirdly, Borghi et al. (45) reported that the entire -synuclein protein is released by neurons into the cerebrospinal fluid. Moreover, the detection of extracellular -synuclein and/or its modified forms in body fluids, particularly in human plasma (46), strongly suggests that cells normally secrete -synuclein into their surrounding media, both in vitro and in vivo. Finally, -synuclein, a member of the synuclein superfamily, which shares 73% amino acid identity across the -synuclein amphipathic domain, was found to be overexpressed in infiltrating breast carcinoma (47). Interestingly, it has an abnormal pattern of expression in some neurodegenerative diseases, and modulates the expression of certain MMP genes, suggesting its involvement in the action mechanism of neuropathologies mediated through MMPs (48, 49). Notwithstanding the many previous reports on this topic, the cellular mechanism by which -synuclein is secreted into the cerebrospinal fluid and the question of which proteases are involved in the processing required generating the smaller fragments of -synuclein, such as NAC, have not yet been clearly elucidated. To assess the possibility of the extracellular localization of -synuclein in vivo, we analyzed the localization of -synuclein in the mouse brain using electron microscopy.2 We found that -synuclein is primarily localized in the presynaptic nerve terminals, whereas a moderate intensity of -synuclein immunoreactivity is present in the cytoplasm and nucleoplasm of the cerebral cortical neurons, as well as the plasma membrane, ribosomes, rough endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondria, small vesicles and nuclear outer membrane.2 Interestingly, however, -synuclein immunoreactivity is also associated with the postsynaptic areas and synaptic clefts,2 which supports the current observation of -synuclein immunoreactivity in SK-N-BE cells, tending to implicate the extracellular localization of -synuclein. The present data suggest that the overexpression of -synuclein triggers its extracellular secretion, as well as a remarkable up-regulation of MMP-3 expression. -Synuclein"

Notwithstanding the many previous reports on this topic, the cellular mechanism by which -synuclein is secreted into the cerebrospinal fluid and the question of which proteases are involved in the processing required generating the smaller fragments of -synuclein, such as NAC, have not yet been clearly elucidated. To assess the possibility of the extracellular localization of -synuclein in vivo, we analyzed the localization of -synuclein in the mouse brain using electron microscopy.2 We found that -synuclein is primarily localized in the presynaptic nerve terminals, whereas a moderate intensity of -synuclein immunoreactivity is present in the cytoplasm and nucleoplasm of the cerebral cortical neurons, as well as the plasma membrane, ribosomes, rough endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondria, small vesicles and nuclear outer membrane.2 Interestingly, however, -synuclein immunoreactivity is also associated with the postsynaptic areas and synaptic clefts,2 which supports the current observation of -synuclein immunoreactivity in SK-N-BE cells, tending to implicate the extracellular localization of -synuclein. The present data suggest that the overexpression of -synuclein triggers its extracellular secretion, as well as a remarkable up-regulation of MMP-3 expression. -Synuclein is cleaved most effectively in vitro by MMP-3, generating an 6.5-kDa major fragment, whereas it could be digested in some extents by MMP-14, MMP-2, MMP-1, and MMP-9. Furthermore, upon its stimulation by the intracellular formation of nitric oxide, -synuclein is secreted as an NAC-like smaller fragment, resulting in the increased formation of extracellular protein inclusions. The existence of such a role for MMPs during PD is further supported by the finding that significant levels of MMP-3 expression are observed arising from the substantia nigra area into the nigrostriatal dopaminergic pathways in 6-OHDA-injected PD rat brain model. With the purpose of assessing whether -synuclein fragment is the same peptide as the NAC co-aggregated with A in AD, MALDI-TOF mass spectral peptide fingerprinting was performed to clarify the exact amino acids cleaved by MMP-3 within the -synuclein. The analysis revealed that, upon incubation of -synuclein with MMP-3, -synuclein was gradually and completely broken down from its C-terminal end within 3 h, which led to the generation of total four major and three minor fragments.

Phrase: "(55) have recently reported that MMP activation also involves S-nitrosylation. Consistent with these reports, the present study demonstrated that the activation of MMP-3 is induced upon the stimulation provided by a nitric oxide donor in neuronal cells, triggering the digestion of extracellular -synuclein, and subsequently promoting its amyloidogenic properties, as compared with those of the intact -synuclein. However, we could not rule out the possibility that more than one MMP (e.g. MMP-3) are actually involved in the digestion the -synuclein in vivo. Taken together, our current findings suggest that the impairment of cellular anti-oxidative mechanisms or the overproduction of reactive species may be a primary event leading to the onset and progression of neurodegenerative synucleopathies. Accordingly, efforts to elucidate the precise mechanism for this hazardous state could lead to the development of novel therapeutic strategies for PD and other synucleinopathies.

Phrase: "N-BE cells, tending to implicate the extracellular localization of -synuclein. The present data suggest that the overexpression of -synuclein triggers its extracellular secretion, as well as a remarkable up-regulation of MMP-3 expression. -Synuclein is cleaved most effectively in vitro by MMP-3, generating an 6.5-kDa major fragment, whereas it could be digested in some extents by MMP-14, MMP-2, MMP-1, and MMP-9. Furthermore, upon its stimulation by the intracellular formation of nitric oxide, -synuclein is secreted as an NAC-like smaller fragment, resulting in the increased formation of extracellular protein inclusions. The existence of such a role for MMPs during PD is further supported by the finding that significant levels of MMP-3 expression are observed arising from the substantia nigra area into the nigrostriatal dopaminergic pathways in 6-OHDA-injected PD rat brain model. With the purpose of assessing whether -synuclein fragment is the same peptide as the NAC co-aggregated with A in AD, MALDI-TOF mass spectral peptide fingerprinting was performed to clarify the exact amino acids cleaved by MMP-3 within the -synuclein. The analysis revealed that, upon incubation of -synuclein with MMP-3, -synuclein was gradually and completely broken down from its C-terminal end within 3 h, which led to the generation of total four major and three minor fragments. In addition, MMP-3 was shown to have at least four different cleavage sites within the non-amyloid plaque sequence (Glu61-Val95) of -synuclein, strongly indicating that MMP-3 affects the aggregation pattern of -synuclein in some way. This was confirmed by the finding that MMP-3-digested -synuclein fragments have caused different kinetics of the protein aggregation and subsequent neurotoxic effect. View larger version (25K): [in this window] [in a new window]  FIG. 6. Effect of MMP-3-mediated cleavage of -synuclein on its aggregate formation and cytotoxicity. A and B, aggregation kinetics of -synuclein in the presence of the -synuclein fragments produced by MMP-3 was evaluated with turbidity (A) and thioflavin-T binding fluorescence (B). Protein aggregations of -synuclein were carried out in the presence of 100 g of -synuclein with or without the MMP-3 (0.6 g) treatment. The extent of the digestion is shown in the inset (A), and compared with control. The arrowhead indicates monomeric -synuclein. Turbidity (A) and amyloid formation (B) in the presence (open circle) and absence (closed circle) of the fragments were examined during incubation by measuring absorbance at 405 nm and thioflavin-T binding fluorescence, respectively, as described under ""Experimental Procedures."" C, cell viability was measured by MTT extract assay after treatment with either the intact -synuclein aggregate (Syn) or the -synuclein aggregate after its MMP-3-mediated cleavage (S+MMP3) (**, p < 0.01 versus control; *, p < 0.05). D, morphological differences of the -synuclein aggregates. Protein aggregates of -synuclein prepared in the absence (Control) and presence (MMP-3)of the MMP-3-derived fragments of -synuclein were examined with electron microscope under magnifications of x80,000. The scale bars represent 100 nm.  View larger version (49K): [in this window] [in a new window]  FIG. 7. Increase of MMP-3 levels in the substantia nigra region of intrastriatally 6-OHDA-injected rat brain. Triple intrastriatal injections of 8 M 6-OHDA into the rat brain were carried out. Three weeks after injection, the rat brain was fixed and sliced, and the midbrain slice sections containing the substantia nigra were prepared for histological studies. Immunohistochemical analysis was performed with anti-MMP-3 antibodies, as indicated.  There are numerous reports to suggest that a variety of structural modifications in -synuclein affect its inclusion morphology pattern and aggregation kinetics. For example, the A53T and A30P mutations of -synuclein increase its iron-dependent aggregation and toxicity, compared with wild type -synuclein (50). Furthermore, the Ser-129 residue of -synuclein is selectively and extensively phosphorylated, and the phosphorylated -synuclein is subsequently targeted to mono- and di-ubiquitination in synucleinopathy brains (51, 52). Although the structural modification of -synuclein, due to its phosphorylation, leads to a change in the aggregation kinetics and its morphology, the current data show that the proteolytic cleavage of -synuclein could also affect the pattern and biochemical properties of its abnormal intracytoplasmic accumulation in a similar way. Using zymography, Lorenzl et al. (20) observed a reduction in the MMP-2 levels in the substantia nigra obtained from postmortem brain tissue of a PD patient, as compared with age-matched control cases, suggesting that the alteration of the expression of MMPs in the substantia nigra of PD may contribute to the disease pathogenesis. The present study provided additional supporting evidence to suggest that the increased levels of MMP-3 are associated with the pathogenesis of PD, as shown in the 6-OHDA-injected rat PD model. Although MMPs are implicated in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases and stroke, the mechanism of MMP activation remains unclear. Reactive oxygen species have also been shown to be important messenger molecules in the induction of several genes. Brenneisen et al. (54) provided evidence that H2O2 is an important intermediate in the downstream signaling pathway, ultimately leading to the induction of increased steady state MMP-1 mRNA levels. Gu et al. (55) have recently reported that MMP activation also involves S-nitrosylation. Consistent with these reports, the present study demonstrated that the activation of MMP-3 is induced upon the stimulation provided by a nitric oxide donor in neuronal cells, triggering the digestion of extracellular -synuclein, and subsequently promoting its amyloidogenic properties, as compared with those of the intact -synuclein. However, we could not rule out the possibility that more than one MMP (e.g. MMP-3) are actually involved in the digestion the -synuclein in vivo. Taken together, our current findings suggest that the impairment of cellular anti-oxidative mechanisms or the overproduction of reactive species may be a primary event leading to the onset and progression of neurodegenerative synucleopathies. Accordingly, efforts to elucidate the precise mechanism for this hazardous state could lead to the development of novel therapeutic strategies for PD and other synucleinopathies.
