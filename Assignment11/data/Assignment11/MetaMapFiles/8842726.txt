The nuclear remains (NR) do not contain any of these proteins. DISCUSSION Using five polyclonal antisera in immunofluorescence and CLSM experiments, we have shown that huntingtin is localized both in the cytoplasm and in the nucleus, in different cell lines of mammalian origin. These cells include mouse embryonic fibroblasts, human skin fibroblasts and a mouse neuroblastoma cell line. In the cytoplasm, huntingtin does not seem to colocalize exclusively with one particular structure or organelle, but instead is rather dispersed throughout the whole cytoplasm with a partial association with microtubule-like structures (see also 22 ,23 )."
Processing 00000000.tx.119: CLSM studies have indicated, that in the nucleus for huntingtin a characteristic signal can be observed, with an exclusion of the nucleoli.

Phrase: "Raf) and [alpha]-tubulin (tub) are mainly found in the cytoplasmic fraction, while the nuclear proteins CBP and p53 are found in the nuclear fraction (N). The nuclear remains (NR) do not contain any of these proteins. DISCUSSION Using five polyclonal antisera in immunofluorescence and CLSM experiments, we have shown that huntingtin is localized both in the cytoplasm and in the nucleus, in different cell lines of mammalian origin. These cells include mouse embryonic fibroblasts, human skin fibroblasts and a mouse neuroblastoma cell line. In the cytoplasm, huntingtin does not seem to colocalize exclusively with one particular structure or organelle, but instead is rather dispersed throughout the whole cytoplasm with a partial association with microtubule-like structures (see also 22 ,23 ). CLSM studies have indicated, that in the nucleus for huntingtin a characteristic signal can be observed, with an exclusion of the nucleoli. The specificity of the observed nuclear signal in the immunofluorescence experiments was shown by preincubation/competition assays and by using an affinity-purified antibody, which recognizes normal as well as mutant huntingtin. In addition, essentially the same pattern of cellular and nuclear localization was seen using several additional polyclonal antibodies raised against various other huntingtin-GST fusion proteins (K.d.R., M.S. and J.D., unpublished results). The latter finding underscores the conclusion that the nuclear signal is not caused by spurious activities. For the human skin fibroblasts, the dual cytoplasmic and nuclear localization was confirmed using biochemical subcellular fractionation procedures. In agreement with the analysis of tissue culture cells, previous immunohistochemical studies on tissue material also showed a cytoplasmic signal in most cell types and an additional nuclear signal in several cell types, including neurons (13 ). However, other groups have not been able to detect a nuclear localization of huntingtin in various tissues, including neuronal tissue (9 ,10 ,18 ,22 ,23 ). This contradiction may be due to differences in the antibodies used and/or differences in experimental procedures, including the preparation of brain tissue material. Different levels of metabolic and regulatory activity of cells during the preparation of brain tissue material may cause changes in the observed subcellular localization of huntingtin and influence the results. Although for huntingtin, the attention has been focused primarily on the analysis of the expression and the subcellular localization in (parts of the) brain, in several reports the analysis of various cell lines has been described. These cell lines include the adenovirus-transformed human embryonic kidney cell line HEK-293 (24 ), SV40-transformed monkey kidney cells Cos-1 (18 ) and human lymphoblastoid cell lines (9 ). In all these cell lines huntingtin could be detected in the cytoplasm, but only in one of those cell lines, namely HEK-293, huntingtin was also found in the nucleus (24 ). In line with our experiments, the cytoplasmic signal for huntingtin does not seem to be preferentially associated with certain cytoplasmic structures or organelles, but seems present in different regions of the cytoplasm. The immunofluorescence procedures for cultured cells in our experiments were basically the same as in Bessert et al. for HEK-293 (24 ) and as in those of Trottier and coworkers for the Cos-1 cells (18 ). The conclusion derived by this last group of an exclusive cytoplasmic localization for huntingtin was based on the analysis of the subcellular distribution of overexpressed exogenous huntingtin in various transfectants. However, it is known that overexpression of a protein can significantly affect its cellular distribution, while a very strong signal of the overexpressed protein may render conclusions on the distribution of the endogenous protein difficult. Differences in the antibodies used may further contribute to the differences in the observed subcellular localization. Our results suggest that in several mammalian tissue culture cells huntingtin is present not only in the cytoplasm but also in the nucleus. In addition, it appears that also the relative distribution of huntingtin between the cytoplasmic and nuclear compartments differs per cell type. The nuclear signal, as well as its punctate nature, was strongest in the mouse embryonic cells. Combined with the increased abundance of huntingtin in rat embryos (25 ) and the early embryonic lethality of its absence in homozygous knockout mice (26 -28 ), these results suggest that besides its cytoplasmic function(s), a nuclear function of huntingtin at some stage in differentiation or in some phases of the cell cycle may not be excluded. Thus, our results bring huntingtin back in focus as a potential regulatory factor in nuclear processes, such as transcription. A possible role in transcription is in line with some structural features of huntingtin. A number of transcriptional activators have been described which, like huntingtin, contain a polyglutamine stretch (19 ,29 ,30 ). In addition, a leucine zipper-like motif is found in huntingtin (13 ). This latter motif is also found in many DNA-binding proteins and transcriptional activators (31 ). The cytoplasmic localization, which was found in cell lines and tissues analyzed, does not disfavour an additional role for huntingtin in nuclear processes. For example, the activities of certain transcriptional activators, including the transcription factor NF-[kappa]B, are in part regulated by transport to and from the nucleus (32 ). For huntingtin a similar mechanism might be involved. Another possibility is that differential splicing of huntingtin RNA results in differences in the subcellular localization of the proteins, as has been recently described for FMR1 (33 ). The fact that huntingtin is a very large protein and thus potentially has a large interface for interactions with a variety of cellular proteins, makes it quite plausible that the protein has multiple functions in the cell. At present we favour the model that at least one of the functions of huntingtin in cycling cells and in several differentiated cells is the interaction with certain transcriptional regulators or other important regulatory proteins (see also 13 ). Deregulation of this interaction process as a consequence of (CAG)n repeat expansion, possibly associated with aging, may contribute to the process of cell death observed in neuronal cells of affected individuals. Especially, a partially nuclear localization of a mutant huntingtin protein in cycling progenitors of neuronal cells may well cause alterations which have effects only after differentiation. MATERIALS AND METHODS Cell lines Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were prepared from mouse embryos obtained by hysterectomy of 13-17 days pregnant mice. Embryos were collected in phosphate buffered saline (PBS, GIBCO BRL), the head and liver were removed and the remainder of the embryos was washed several times in PBS and subsequently cut to pieces with scissors. After three rounds of 15 min of trypsinization single cells were collected and subsequently seeded at a density of 3.5 * 104/cm2. Cells were cultured on Petri dishes coated with gelatin in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) without phenol-red (GIBCO BRL) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (GIBCO BRL). Human skin fibroblasts were cultured in DMEM without phenol-red (GIBCO BRL) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (GIBCO BRL). Lymphoblastoid cell lines of patients and controls were maintained in RPMI-1640 (GIBCO BRL) supplemented with 15% fetal calf serum. The mouse neuroblastoma cell line N1E-115 (34 ) was kindly provided by Dr P. van der Saag (Hubrecht laboratory, Utrecht, The Netherlands). This cell line was cultured in minimal essential medium (MEM; GIBCO BRL) supplemented with 2% fetal calf serum. Differentiation of the neuroblastoma cells was induced by adding 2% DMSO to the medium. Antibody production Polyclonal antibodies against huntingtin were raised by the injection of rabbits with synthetic peptides or a huntingtin-glutathione S-transferase (htt-GST) fusion protein. Peptide 1, corresponding to amino acid positions 3114-3141 (13 ) raised antibodies 1356 and 1358. Peptide 2 corresponds to aa 701-744 and yielded antibodies 1359 and 1495. Affinity purification of anti-peptide antibodies was performed, according to standard procedures (13 ). These four antibodies were kindly provided by Dr A.T. Hoogeveen (13 ). The huntingtin-GST fusion protein containing aa 1929-2421 resulted in antibody 93. GST antibodies were removed from serum 93 by two rounds of overnight incubation at 4oC with GST-beads. Subsequently, serum 93 was affinity purified on an immunoblot containing 50 [mu]g of the huntingtin-GST fusion protein and eluted with 0.1 M glycine pH 2.5 as described (35 ). Immunofluorescence analysis All incubations were performed at room temperature.
