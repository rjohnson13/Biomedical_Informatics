In the process of analyzing patterns of A deposition in R1.40 mice, we observed extensive variation between transgenic animals at the same age (data not shown) indicating the presence of stochastic and/or genetic factors that impact A deposition. To characterize genetic modifiers of APP processing, A metabolism and A deposition and neuropathology in mice, the R1.40 YAC transgene was transferred into three different genetic backgrounds by repeated backcrossing to the inbred mouse strains C57BL/6J, DBA/2J and 129S1/SvImJ and selection for the R1.40 transgene at each generation. The animals described in the current study were backcrossed to the tenth generation to C57BL/6J [abbreviated B6-R1.40, official designation B6.Cg-Tg(APP)R1.40Lmb], the tenth generation to DBA/2J [abbreviated D2-R1.40, official designation D2.Cg-Tg(APP)R1.40Lm] and the fifth generation to 129S1/SvImJ [abbreviated 129S1-R1.40, official designation 129S1.Cg-Tg(APP)R1.40Lmb].

Phrase: "CTF), which is subsequently processed by -secretase to generate A of either 40 (A40) or 42 (A42) amino acids in length. However, at present the exact relationship between the levels of A and the various APP processing products and the deposition of A remains poorly defined. Our laboratory has initiated a screen to characterize genetic factors that modify APP processing, A metabolism and A deposition in a transgenic mouse model of AD. Previously, we generated and characterized the genomic-based APP transgenic mouse line R1.40, containing several copies of a yeast artificial chromosome (YAC) with the entire human APP gene harboring the Swedish FAD mutation (69). In the current manuscript, we generated mouse strains containing the R1.40 transgene in defined genetic backgrounds by repeated backcrossing to three inbred mouse strains. Despite similar levels of holo-APP expression in the three strains, the levels of brain APP CTFs as well as brain and plasma A40 and A42 in young animals varied depending upon genetic background. In addition, the congenic strains exhibited dramatic alterations in the age of onset of A deposition. These studies demonstrate that A metabolism and deposition are under genetic control in mice and that altered APP processing and A metabolism in young animals may have implications for later development of AD-like neuropathology.  RESULTS TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION RESULTS DISCUSSION MATERIALS AND METHODS REFERENCES  Generation of R1.40 congenic strains of defined genetic background We have focused on developing a genomic-based mouse model of AD, through the introduction of complete copies of human AD genes into the germline of mice (610). Transgenic line R1.40 contains the entire human APP gene carried on a YAC with the K670N/M671L mutation (6,11). We have demonstrated that line R1.40 develops extracellular A deposits and associated neuropathology that closely resembles those alterations observed in human AD (79). In the process of analyzing patterns of A deposition in R1.40 mice, we observed extensive variation between transgenic animals at the same age (data not shown) indicating the presence of stochastic and/or genetic factors that impact A deposition. To characterize genetic modifiers of APP processing, A metabolism and A deposition and neuropathology in mice, the R1.40 YAC transgene was transferred into three different genetic backgrounds by repeated backcrossing to the inbred mouse strains C57BL/6J, DBA/2J and 129S1/SvImJ and selection for the R1.40 transgene at each generation. The animals described in the current study were backcrossed to the tenth generation to C57BL/6J [abbreviated B6-R1.40, official designation B6.Cg-Tg(APP)R1.40Lmb], the tenth generation to DBA/2J [abbreviated D2-R1.40, official designation D2.Cg-Tg(APP)R1.40Lm] and the fifth generation to 129S1/SvImJ [abbreviated 129S1-R1.40, official designation 129S1.Cg-Tg(APP)R1.40Lmb]. On average, animals at the fifth generation back-cross are 94% identical to the inbred line (termed incipient congenic), while animals at the tenth generation backcross are 99.8% identical to the inbred line (termed certified congenic) (12). The integrity and copy number of the transgene in the three congenic strains was confirmed by Southern blotting (data not shown). Analysis of holo-APP and APP CTFs In initial experiments designed to examine the effect of genetic background on APP processing, brain extracts from hemizygous B6-R1.40, D2-R1.40 and 129S1-R1.40 transgenic mice were analyzed by western blot analysis for various APP products. Steady-state levels of brain holo-APP and APP CTFs were determined at 4 weeks of age (Fig.1 and Table 1). No significant differences in the fold increase in total APP expression (mouse+human) over endogenous C57BL/6J App was observed in the three sets of samples, suggesting that the levels of brain holo-APP are approximately equal in the three congenic strains. By contrast, the relative steady-state levels of the APP CTFs (8), expressed as the ratio of CTF/(CTF+CTF) was significantly lower in the 129S1-R1.40 brain extracts compared with either the B6-R1.40 or D2-R1.40 extracts (Fig.1 and Table 1). Analysis of (B6x129S1)F1-R1.40 brain extracts, revealed an indistinguishable CTF ratio when compared with the B6-R1.40 parental strain. These results suggest that the gene alleles responsible for the lower CTF ratio observed in the 129S1-R1.40 congenics are recessive to the high B6 alleles. On the other hand, analysis of the (D2x129S1)F1-R1.40 brain extracts revealed a CTF ratio indistinguishable from the 129S1-R1.40 parental strain (Fig.1), suggesting that the alleles responsible for the lower CTF ratio observed in the 129S1-R1.40 congenics is dominant to the high DBA alleles. These data demonstrate that there is altered production and turnover of APP CTFs dependent upon genetic loci in the different mouse backgrounds.

(AC) Whole brain protein extracts (24ml of 1% CHAPS with protease inhibitors per gram of tissue) were prepared from 4-week-old hemizygous B6-R1.40, D2-R1.40 and 129S1-R1.40 APP YAC transgenic mice. 25g of total protein was loaded onto 412% gradient acrylamide gels followed by western blotting with APP C-terminal antibody 369. Shown on the right is the approximate size in kDa. (B) Levels of total holo-APP (mouse+human) were analyzed in six animals (three male and three female) for each congenic strain by western blot and quantified relative to endogenous mouse App in a single C57BL/6J non-transgenic animal as described previously (8). Error bars represent standard error. No sex differences were observed in any of the samples. In addition, no significant differences in the levels of total holo-APP (mouse+human) were detected between the three congenic strains. (C) Relative levels of the APP CTFs [CTF/CTF(+)] were determined for the three congenic strains and two F1s [129S1-R1.40, n=13; B6-R1.40, n=17; D2-R1.40, n=16; (B6x129S1)F1-R1.40, n=10; (D2x129S1)F1-R1.40, n=10]. Error bars represent standard error. In all three congenic strains, females exhibited higher CTF ratios than males, but this only reached statistical significance in the B6-R1.40 animals (P-value=0.016). Statistical comparison of different strain values was calculated by ANOVA with P-values of: 0.003 (129S1-R1.40 versus B6-R1.40), 0.023 (129S1-R1.40 versus D2-R1.40), 0.011 [129S1-R1.40 versus (B6x129S1)F1-R1.40] and 0.005 [D2-R1.40 versus (D2x129S1)F1-R1.40].

APP Processing and A metabolism in R1.40 congenic strains  Analysis of A metabolism To further examine the effects of genetic background on APP processing, the levels of the two major isoforms of A (A40 and A42) in brain extracts and plasma from 4-week-old hemizygous B6-R1.40, D2-R1.40 and 129S1-R1.40 congenics were determined by ELISA. Pairwise comparisons revealed B6-R1.40 animals with the highest levels of both brain and plasma A40 and A42, 129S1-R1.40 animals with intermediate levels and D2-R1.40 animals with the lowest levels (Fig.2 and Table 1). The statistically significant differences in steady-state levels of A between D2-R1.40 and B6-R1.40 animals were maintained at both 21 and 60 days of age (Fig.3). Immunoprecipitation/mass spectrometry analysis of brain A from the 129S1-R1.40, B6-R1.40 and D2-R1.40 congenics revealed no significant differences in the identity of the A species produced (data not shown). These novel results suggest that the altered steady-state level of A in young animals is under the control of unique genetic loci in the R1.40 congenic strains.

Error bars represent standard error. The only significant sex differences were a slight increase in brain A40 in males compared to females (P-value=0.02) and an increase in plasma A42 in females compared with males (P-value=0.003) in the D2-R1.40 animals.

GuanidineHCl-extracted brain homogenates from four male B6-R1.40 and D2-R1.40 mice at 21 (only three D2-R1.40 animals were assayed at this timepoint), 28 and 60 days of age were run on A40 ELISAs with A standards and expressed as pmol A/g brain tissue (brain extracts). Error bars represent standard error. Statistical comparison of the different strain values was calculated by ANOVA (with Sidak correction for multiple comparisons) with P-values of: <0.001 (21 days); 0.002 (28 days); and 0.001 (60 days).  To gain further insight into genetic differences that result in high A levels in the B6-R1.40 strain and low A levels in the D2-R1.40 strain, four-week-old hemizygous (B6xD2) F1-R1.40 and (B6xD2)F2-R1.40 transgenic mice were generated and analyzed for the levels of brain A40 and A42 by ELISA (Fig.4). The levels of brain A peptides in the (B6xD2) F1s were not significantly different from the B6-R1.40 parental strain, but were significantly different from the D2-R1.40 parental strain. These results demonstrate that the gene alleles controlling the high levels of brain A in young B6-R1.40 congenics are dominant over the low D2-R1.40 alleles. In addition, the levels of brain A40 and A42 in the F2 population varied across both parental and F1 A values and were strongly correlated within the F2 population (r=0.9, P<0.0001, two-tailed Pearson test), suggesting that the same genetic factors regulate both A peptides.

Formic acid extracted brain samples from 4-week-old hemizygous B6-R1.40 congenic mice (B6, n=12, six male and six female), D2-R1.40 congenic mice (DBA, n=12, six male and six female), (B6xD2)F1-R1.40s (F1, n=15, seven male and eight female) and (B6xD2)F2-R1.40s (F2, n=40, 20 male and 20 female) were prepared. Brain samples were run on A40 (A) and A42 (B) ELISAs with A standards and expressed as pmol A/g brain tissue. Horizontal bars represent the means for each group. No significant sex differences were observed in either the F1 or F2 populations. Statistical comparison of different strain values was calculated by ANOVA (with Sidak correction for multiple comparisons) with P-values of: <0.001 (A40, B6-R1.40 versus D2-R1.40); 0.0007 [A40, (B6xD2)F1-R1.40 versus D2-R1.40]; <0.001 (A42, B6-R1.40 versus D2-R1.40); 0.014 [A42, (B6xD2)F1-R1.40 versus D2-R1.40].  Finally, correlational analysis of steady-state APP CTF ratios and A levels on individual animals where both measurements were obtained (B6-R1.40, n=7; D2-R1.40, n=6; 129S1-R1.40, n=9) revealed no significant correlation between these two biochemical measurements (data not shown). This is consistent with our previous observations that revealed that steady-state APP CTF ratios are not predictive for the levels of A in different brains regions of R1.40 transgenic mice in a mixed B6-129S1 background or in different brain regions of Tg2576, a cDNA-based APP transgenic mouse model in a mixed B6-SJL background (8). Analysis of A deposition To examine whether the altered steady-state levels of A in young congenics is correlated with altered A deposition later in life, aging studies of homozygous B6-R1.40, D2-R1.40 and (B6xD2)F1-R1.40 animals were conducted. While no A deposition was observed in any animals at 5 months of age (data not shown), all homozygous 13.5-month-old B6-R1.40 animals (n=4) exhibited A deposition in parietal cortex (Fig.5B). By contrast, no A deposition was observed in 13.5-month-old homozygous D2-R1.40 animals (n=3; Fig.5A). The 13.5-month-old homozygous (B6xD2)F1-R1.40 animals (n=3) also exhibited A deposition in parietal cortex (Fig.5C), indicating dominance for B6 depositing alleles over D2 non-depositing alleles. This difference in A deposition was maintained at 17 months of age (data not shown) and by 20 months of age B6-R1.40 homozygous animals exhibited substantial A deposition in the frontal (Fig.5H) and parietal cortex (Fig.5E; n=3), while D2-R1.40 animals at the same age still lacked A deposition (Fig.5G and D) (n=3). (B6xD2)F1-R1.40 animals (n=3) at 20 months of age also exhibited A deposition in frontal (Fig.5I) and parietal cortex (Fig.5F), further suggesting dominance of the B6 depositing alleles. These results suggest that the alterations in A deposition in B6-R1.40 and D2-R1.40 congenic strains reflect the action of modifier loci. These results also demonstrate that elevated steady-state levels of A in young B6-R1.40 animals may be correlated with an earlier age of A deposition. This is the first demonstration that both A metabolism and A deposition are modified dependent upon genetic background in the mouse.

DISCUSSION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION RESULTS DISCUSSION MATERIALS AND METHODS REFERENCES  The generation of A via the proteolytic processing of APP and its subsequent deposition into senile plaques is thought to be central to AD pathogenesis (3). However, the relationship between the levels of A and the various APP processing products generated over the lifespan of humans and the onset of AD remains quite obscure. For example, the levels of A measured in plasma or fibroblasts from human subjects do not consistently predict whether or when AD will develop (13,14). In addition, the increase in A secretion caused by individual FAD mutations does not necessarily correlate with age of onset within FAD pedigrees (1517). This is probably due to numerous confounding environmental and genetic factors inherent in human population-based aging studies. Consistent with this hypothesis, considerable variation in the duration, severity, symptoms, age of onset and clinical/neuropathological correlations of AD has been observed in multiple studies (1822). Notably, even within families containing the same early-onset FAD mutation, substantial variation in symptoms, age of onset, pathology, duration and penetrance is exhibited (2325) suggesting the presence of modifier loci for A metabolism and AD in these families. Given the difficulties in identifying the factors that modulate risk for developing AD in humans we have turned to the mouse as a genetically defined and tractable model system to gain insight into the relationship between A metabolism and AD pathogenesis. In the current studies we have focused on examining the effects of defined genetic backgrounds and environment on APP processing, A metabolism and A deposition in a transgenic mouse model of AD. We previously generated and characterized mouse line R1.40, a genomic-based APP transgenic model that exhibits numerous AD phenotypes (610). In this report, using the R1.40 line in defined inbred mouse strains, we show that APP processing, A metabolism and A deposition are modified dependent upon genetic background in the mouse and that alterations in steady-state levels of A in young animals may impact the onset of A deposition later in life. These congenic transgenic mouse strains now provide a unique resource to characterize gender-specific, environmental-specific as well as spatial and temporal alterations in APP processing, A metabolism and A deposition. In addition, the congenic strains will enable genetic mapping studies to identify genes responsible for alterations in both in vivo A metabolism and A deposition. Our results demonstrate that genetic background impacts several steps leading from APP processing to A metabolism and A deposition. First, the choice between - and -secretase cleavage in APP processing was significantly different as measured by ratios of steady-state CTF and CTF in the three congenic lines."

Phrase: "CTF in the three congenic lines. Furthermore, the levels of A40 and A42 in both brain and plasma varied among the congenic lines with highest levels in the B6-R1.40 line, lowest levels in the D2-R1.40 line and intermediate levels in the 129S1-R1.40 line. Importantly, these alterations in APP processing occurred despite equivalent levels of holo-APP. Surprisingly, the relative steady-state levels of APP CTFs was not correlated with the levels of A in the congenic lines, suggesting that these two biochemical measurements are regulated independently. Genetic analysis of A40 and A42 levels in (B6xD2) F1-R1.40 revealed that the B6 high alleles were dominant over the low D2 alleles. Finally, the B6-R1.40 and (B6xD2) F1-R1.40 lines, which demonstrated elevated levels of A compared to D2-R1.40 animals at young ages, exhibited enhanced A deposition when compared to age-matched D2-R1.40 animals. Our results further suggest that in the B6-R1.40 and D2-R1.40 genetic backgrounds, the levels of steady-state brain and plasma A in very young animals may be correlated with the presence of A deposition at 13.5, 17 and 20 months of age. B6-R1.40 animals first exhibit A deposition by 13.5 months of age while D2-R1.40 animals remain free of A deposition until at least 20 months of age. This difference of 6.5 months (or more) in the onset of A pathology represents an age of onset delay of at least 48% (6.5 months/13.5 months). If a lifespan-corrected, proportional delay were observed in humans, the average age of onset of A pathology would be delayed 30 years, drastically reducing the rates of AD pathology observed in human populations (26,27). Identification of the mouse genes responsible for the delay in A deposition observed in these mouse strains may thus prove critical in efforts to identify factors that delay the age of onset of AD in human populations. Furthermore, these studies have important implications for the study of human AD in that the levels of A in very young individuals may be correlated with the age of onset of AD pathology. This hypothesis will need to be examined in greater detail using a large population of animals in which the levels of plasma A are measured in each animal at a variety of ages and correlated with A deposition in the same animals at an older age. This type of longitudinal study in a large group of F2 animals will help determine whether the genetic factors that regulate A metabolism and A deposition in these strains are the same or different and thus provide insight into the relationship between the levels of A throughout aging and eventual A deposition. This study also has profound implications for the study of the various transgenic mouse models of AD which are largely maintained on hybrid genetic backgrounds (2832). Our data demonstrate that significant phenotypic alterations in A metabolism and deposition are conferred by genetic background. Phenotypic variability due to genetic background has been suggested in other APP transgenic mouse models (3335), but has yet to be formally addressed experimentally. For example, the PD-APP transgenic model of AD, which is derived from a hybrid background that includes the C56BL/6J and DBA/2J inbred strains examined here, exhibits extensive variability in A deposition dependent upon the parent of origin of the transgene (35). The results presented here suggest that interpretation of biochemical, pathological and behavioral data generated in the various transgenic models on mixed genetic backgrounds is likely to be substantially complicated by various genetic factors segregating uniquely in the progeny of these models. In summary, our results demonstrate that APP processing, A metabolism and A deposition are genetically modified quantitative traits in the mouse which offer the opportunity for genetic analysis to identify novel genes involved in APP processing and A deposition. Such studies will provide a more complete understanding of the relationship between alterations in A metabolism and APP processing in young animals and the eventual deposition of A in aged animals. Intriguingly, our recent studies demonstrate that the levels of various APP processing products (including APP CTFs and A) in different brains regions of R1.40 transgenic mice are not predictive for later development of A deposition (8), suggesting the presence of additional regional and or age-related factors that modulate the pattern of A deposition. Finally, these studies complement ongoing human studies using plasma A as a quantitative trait in late-onset AD (36), although the mouse studies offer the distinct advantages of defined breeding strategies to help identify numerous quantitative traits, measurement of both brain and plasma A and various APP products at a variety of ages, as well as the complete genomic DNA sequence of the relevant polymorphic strains. Identification of genes involved in A metabolism and A deposition in the mouse will likely lead to unique targets for therapeutic intervention in AD.  MATERIALS AND METHODS TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION RESULTS DISCUSSION MATERIALS AND METHODS REFERENCES  Animals R1.40 YAC transgenic animals were previously described (6). Congenic strains were generated by consecutive backcrossing onto one of the following inbred strains (from The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME): B6 (stock number 000664), D2 (stock number 000671) and 129S1 (stock number 002448). Typically transgene positive males were crossed with inbred females, but at least one cross of transgene-positive females with inbred males was made in each series to ensure the inclusion of the inbred Y chromosome. Transgene hemizygosity/homozygosity was determined by fluorescent in situ hybridization (37) and integrity of the transgene was determined by Southern blot analysis with human APP and Alu repetitive element probes (6). We observed the expected Mendelian ratios of control, hemizygous and homozygous animals with repeated back-crossing as well as with intercrossing hemizygotes, demonstrating that the transgene does not alter survival to weaning (data not shown). To generate hemizygous (B6xD2)F1-R1.40 animals, homozygous D2-R1.40 males were crossed with non-transgenic B6 females and the reciprocal cross of homozygous B6-R1.40 males to non-transgenic D2 females was also undertaken. Hemizygous (B6xD2)F2-R1.40 animals were generated by crossing a homozygous (B6xD2)F1-R1.40 male with a non-transgenic B6D2F1 (Jackson Laboratory stock number 100006) female. Homozygous (B6xD2)F1-R1.40 animals were generated by mating homozygous D2-R1.40 males to homozygous B6-R1.40 females. All mice were housed in ventilated microisolator cages on a 12 hour light/dark cycle, were allowed food (Purina 5021) and water ad libitum and were specific pathogen free. Tissue procurement Plasma was obtained from the orbital sinus. Both plasma and brain tissue were immediately frozen after procurement on dry ice before storage at -80C. For neuropathological analysis of older animals, brains were sagitally bisected with half of the brain frozen and half immersion fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate buffered saline for immunohistochemistry. Western blot analysis Analysis of the steady-state levels of holo-APP and APP CTFs was performed on brain extracts from 4-week-old hemizygous congenic strains and F1s as described previously (8) using polyclonal antibody 369 (kindly provided by Sam Gandy, Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, PA, USA), which is specific to the C-terminus of APP.
