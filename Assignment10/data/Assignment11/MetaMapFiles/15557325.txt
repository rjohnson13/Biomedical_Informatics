After incubation, the medium was centrifuged for 15 min at 12,000 x g to remove any cells. The cells were washed and lysed in RIPA buffer. Protein Isolation and Western Blot AnalysisFor Western blot analysis cellular extracts were prepared from Chinese hamster ovary, H4 cells, Tangier fibroblasts, and primary neurons. Cells were washed and scraped in phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in RIPA buffer in the presence of protease inhibitors. Cellular extracts were centrifuged to remove debris. For ABCA1, APP, sAPP/ Western blot analysis, extracts containing 2050 g of total protein were mixed with Tris/glycine reducing buffer, denaturing loading buffer, loaded, and electrophoresed on 8% Tris/glycine gels (Invitrogen). For Western blot analyses of CTF and A cellular extracts and conditioned media were loaded on 1020% Tricine gels (Invitrogen). Gels were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, incubated with the respective primary antibodies followed by secondary antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase and processed for visualization by enhanced chemiluminescence ECL PlusTM (Amersham Biosciences). Antibodies with anti--tubulin and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase were used as an internal standard. The relative intensities of the bands were quantified by densitometry (Molecular Dynamics). Immunoprecipitation and ELISA for AImmunoprecipitation and ELISA for A were performed essentially as before (31, 32). Briefly, A was immunoprecipitated from conditioned medium and immunoblotted using 6E10 antibody. Soluble A was extracted with 2x RIPA buffer and centrifuged at 135,000 x g. In addition, soluble A was extracted using cold 0.4% diethylamine in 100 mM NaCl, centrifuged at 135,000 x g for 1 h at 4 C and neutralized by adding 0.5 M Tris/HCl, pH 6.8. Diethylamine extracts were also used to determine sAPP and sAPP by Western blot. The soluble A extracts were additionally diluted in EC buffer (20 mM sodium phosphate, 2 mM EDTA, 400 mM NaCl, 0.2% bovine serum albumin, 0.05% CHAPS, 0.4% Block Ace, 0.05% NaN3,pH 7.0), and A140 and A142 concentrations were measured by Sandwich ELISA as described before. Briefly, ELISA for A was performed using 6E10 as the capture antibody and anti-Ab40 (G210 mAb) and anti-Ab42 (G213 mAb) monoclonal antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Genetics Company, Schlieren, Switzerland) were used as the detection antibodies. The reaction was developed by TMB Microwell peroxidase substrate system (Kierkegaard and Perry Laboratories, Gaithersburg, PA). The final values of A were based on standard curves using synthetic A140 and A142 peptide standards (Bachem Biosciences, King of Prussia, PA). The amount of A was normalized either to the total protein or to the expression of full-length APP as measured by Western blotting and was expressed as pmol/mg total protein or as a -fold of vehicle-treated control. Statistical AnalysisResults are reported as mean  S.E. Statistical significance was determined by a two-tailed Student's t test (GraphPad Prism version 3.0, GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA).  RESULTS TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION MATERIALS AND METHODS RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES  The Synthetic LXR Ligand T0901317 Induces ABCA1 Expression and Decreases A Secretion in Non-neuronal Cell LinesPreviously, we and others have found (22, 24) that the LXR ligand 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol increased ABCA1 expression and decreased the secretion of A in non-neuronal and neuronal cells. Because it has been shown that the synthetic LXR ligands are more efficacious and less toxic in vivo than endogenous LXR ligands (33) we compared the effects of 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol and the synthetic LXR ligand T0901317 on ABCA1 expression and A secretion. We used Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHOAPPsw) stably transfected with human APP containing a Swedish mutation (APPsw695) that increases the formation of total A. T0901317 applied at the same molar concentration as 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol induced a higher level of ABCA1 protein expression (Fig. 1A). Because LXR acts in a heterodimeric complex with RXR, we examined whether a RXR activator, such as 9-cis-retinoic acid would affect the response to T0901317. The addition of retinoic acid to T0901317 resulted in a further 2-fold increase of ABCA1 protein expression (Fig. 1B, top panel) and similar decrease in Ab40 secretion compared with T0901317 alone (Fig. 1C). These results confirmed that LXR and RXR ligands"

The protein expression level of ABCA1, APP, and -tubulin (-tub) were measured by Western blotting in the whole cell lysates (B), and A140 secretion was measured by ELISA in the conditioned media (C). Student's t test was used to determine significant difference in A40 levels. *, p < 0.05 and **, p < 0.01 compared with T0901317 only.  ApoA-I Treatment Increases the Effect of LXR Ligands on A SecretionTo examine the effect of apolipoprotein-mediated cholesterol efflux, we treated CHOAPPsw cells with increasing concentrations of T0901317 with or without the addition of apoA-I (Fig. 2A). Previously we have shown that treatment with apoA-I alone did not affect A secretion (22). Total A secretion was measured by Western blotting in aliquots of conditioned medium using the 6E10 antibody, which recognizes the first 16 amino acids of A peptide, and was normalized to the expression of intracellular APP. T0901317 at 2 M concentration had no effect on A production regardless of the addition of apoA-I (Fig. 2A). T0901317 at 5 and 10 M inhibited A secretion, and the addition of apoA-1 significantly increased the inhibitory effect of T0901317 as compared with cells without apoA-I (p < 0.01 and p < 0.05, respectively). The effect of apoA-I was confirmed in non-transfected human H4 cells expressing wild type APP treated with 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol. As visible from Fig. 2B, apoA-I and 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol treatment of H4 cells significantly decreased the secretion of total A. To examine how 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol and apoA-I affect the production of different A species, we measured A40 and A42 by ELISA. We found that A140 was decreased more than 5-fold but detected no change in A142. View larger version (24K): [in this window] [in a new window]  FIG. 2. ApoA-I treatment increases the effect of LXR ligands on A secretion. A, CHOAPPsw cells were treated for 24 h with increasing concentrations of LXR ligand T0901317 (T0) and with or without 20 g/ml apoA-I (T0+a). Total A secretion was measured by Western blotting in aliquots of the conditioned media using 6E10 antibody. The rightmost lane is a 5-ng load of A40 standard peptide (A40). Below is the quantification of the band intensity presented as a -fold of control after normalization to APP. Data (mean  S.E.) are the results of triplicate determinations from one experiment. **, p < 0.01 and ***, p < 0.001 compared with the vehicle-treated control. B, non-transfected H4 cells expressing wild type human APP were treated for 24 h with 10 M 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol, and cholesterol efflux was initiated by adding apoA-I (20 g/ml). Control cells were treated with vehicle only without apoA-I. Total A was immunoprecipitated from the medium using the 6E10 Ab, and the samples immunoblotted with the 6E10 Ab as described under ""Materials and Methods.""

The protein expression level of ABCA1, APP, and -tubulin (-tub) were measured by Western blotting in the whole cell lysates (B), and A140 secretion was measured by ELISA in the conditioned media (C). Student's t test was used to determine significant difference in A40 levels. *, p < 0.05 and **, p < 0.01 compared with T0901317 only.  ApoA-I Treatment Increases the Effect of LXR Ligands on A SecretionTo examine the effect of apolipoprotein-mediated cholesterol efflux, we treated CHOAPPsw cells with increasing concentrations of T0901317 with or without the addition of apoA-I (Fig. 2A). Previously we have shown that treatment with apoA-I alone did not affect A secretion (22). Total A secretion was measured by Western blotting in aliquots of conditioned medium using the 6E10 antibody, which recognizes the first 16 amino acids of A peptide, and was normalized to the expression of intracellular APP. T0901317 at 2 M concentration had no effect on A production regardless of the addition of apoA-I (Fig. 2A). T0901317 at 5 and 10 M inhibited A secretion, and the addition of apoA-1 significantly increased the inhibitory effect of T0901317 as compared with cells without apoA-I (p < 0.01 and p < 0.05, respectively). The effect of apoA-I was confirmed in non-transfected human H4 cells expressing wild type APP treated with 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol. As visible from Fig. 2B, apoA-I and 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol treatment of H4 cells significantly decreased the secretion of total A. To examine how 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol and apoA-I affect the production of different A species, we measured A40 and A42 by ELISA. We found that A140 was decreased more than 5-fold but detected no change in A142. View larger version (24K): [in this window] [in a new window]  FIG. 2. ApoA-I treatment increases the effect of LXR ligands on A secretion. A, CHOAPPsw cells were treated for 24 h with increasing concentrations of LXR ligand T0901317 (T0) and with or without 20 g/ml apoA-I (T0+a). Total A secretion was measured by Western blotting in aliquots of the conditioned media using 6E10 antibody. The rightmost lane is a 5-ng load of A40 standard peptide (A40). Below is the quantification of the band intensity presented as a -fold of control after normalization to APP. Data (mean  S.E.) are the results of triplicate determinations from one experiment. **, p < 0.01 and ***, p < 0.001 compared with the vehicle-treated control. B, non-transfected H4 cells expressing wild type human APP were treated for 24 h with 10 M 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol, and cholesterol efflux was initiated by adding apoA-I (20 g/ml). Control cells were treated with vehicle only without apoA-I. Total A was immunoprecipitated from the medium using the 6E10 Ab, and the samples immunoblotted with the 6E10 Ab as described under ""Materials and Methods."" Immunoprecipitation of A from the medium of CHOAPPsw is shown for a comparison on the left. Lanes 1 and 2 are 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol-treated cells, and 3 and 4 are vehicle controls. C, non-transfected H4 cells were treated as in B, and A40 and A42 the were determined in conditioned medium by ELISA as described under ""Materials and Methods."" **, p < 0.01 versus vehicle-treated control.  LXR Ligands Inhibit APP Processing in Primary Neuronal CulturesTo examine the role of LXR/RXR ligands on neuronal processing of APPsw, we used primary neurons from cortices and hippocampi of embryonic mouse brains. The neurons, plated at high density (5 x 105/ml) in 12-well plates were infected at day in vitro 4 with herpes simplex replication-deficient vectors (HSVAPPsw). The expression of human APPsw was determined by Western blotting using the 6E10 antibody, which recognizes only human APP (Fig. 3A). On the next day the infected neurons were treated for 24 h with 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol and apoA-I, and Ab40 secretion was determined by ELISA. 22(R)-Hydroxycholesterol when combined with apoA-I decreased A40 secretion more than 5 times (Fig. 3B). T0901317 applied alone had a slightly smaller effect on A40 secretion (Fig. 3C) even without the addition of apoA-I. The effect of T0901317 on A42 secretion was less prominent thus confirming the data obtained with H4 cells. View larger version (16K): [in this window] [in a new window]  FIG. 3. LXR ligands decrease A secretion from primary neurons. A, primary neuronal cultures were made from dissociated cortices and hippocampi of 1718-day-old mouse embryos, and the neurons at day in vitro 4 were infected with HSV control virus (A, lane 1) or with HSVAPPsw (A, lanes 2 and 3) at multiplicity of infection 5. The expression of human full-length APP (hAPP) was determined 24 h later by Western blotting using the 6E10 antibody that recognizes only human APP. B, ELISA for A40. Neurons were infected as in A and treated with 10 M 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol (22R), and apoA-I was added in 20 mg/ml.

Phrase: "RXR ligand retinoic acid (RA) in 10 M concentrations. The protein expression level of ABCA1, APP, and -tubulin (-tub) were measured by Western blotting in the whole cell lysates (B), and A140 secretion was measured by ELISA in the conditioned media (C). Student's t test was used to determine significant difference in A40 levels. *, p < 0.05 and **, p < 0.01 compared with T0901317 only.  ApoA-I Treatment Increases the Effect of LXR Ligands on A SecretionTo examine the effect of apolipoprotein-mediated cholesterol efflux, we treated CHOAPPsw cells with increasing concentrations of T0901317 with or without the addition of apoA-I (Fig. 2A). Previously we have shown that treatment with apoA-I alone did not affect A secretion (22). Total A secretion was measured by Western blotting in aliquots of conditioned medium using the 6E10 antibody, which recognizes the first 16 amino acids of A peptide, and was normalized to the expression of intracellular APP. T0901317 at 2 M concentration had no effect on A production regardless of the addition of apoA-I (Fig. 2A). T0901317 at 5 and 10 M inhibited A secretion, and the addition of apoA-1 significantly increased the inhibitory effect of T0901317 as compared with cells without apoA-I (p < 0.01 and p < 0.05, respectively). The effect of apoA-I was confirmed in non-transfected human H4 cells expressing wild type APP treated with 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol. As visible from Fig. 2B, apoA-I and 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol treatment of H4 cells significantly decreased the secretion of total A. To examine how 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol and apoA-I affect the production of different A species, we measured A40 and A42 by ELISA. We found that A140 was decreased more than 5-fold but detected no change in A142. View larger version (24K): [in this window] [in a new window]  FIG. 2. ApoA-I treatment increases the effect of LXR ligands on A secretion. A, CHOAPPsw cells were treated for 24 h with increasing concentrations of LXR ligand T0901317 (T0) and with or without 20 g/ml apoA-I (T0+a). Total A secretion was measured by Western blotting in aliquots of the conditioned media using 6E10 antibody. The rightmost lane is a 5-ng load of A40 standard peptide (A40). Below is the quantification of the band intensity presented as a -fold of control after normalization to APP. Data (mean  S.E.) are the results of triplicate determinations from one experiment. **, p < 0.01 and ***, p < 0.001 compared with the vehicle-treated control. B, non-transfected H4 cells expressing wild type human APP were treated for 24 h with 10 M 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol, and cholesterol efflux was initiated by adding apoA-I (20 g/ml). Control cells were treated with vehicle only without apoA-I. Total A was immunoprecipitated from the medium using the 6E10 Ab, and the samples immunoblotted with the 6E10 Ab as described under ""Materials and Methods."" Immunoprecipitation of A from the medium of CHOAPPsw is shown for a comparison on the left. Lanes 1 and 2 are 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol-treated cells, and 3 and 4 are vehicle controls. C, non-transfected H4 cells were treated as in B, and A40 and A42 the were determined in conditioned medium by ELISA as described under ""Materials and Methods."" **, p < 0.01 versus vehicle-treated control.  LXR Ligands Inhibit APP Processing in Primary Neuronal CulturesTo examine the role of LXR/RXR ligands on neuronal processing of APPsw, we used primary neurons from cortices and hippocampi of embryonic mouse brains. The neurons, plated at high density (5 x 105/ml) in 12-well plates were infected at day in vitro 4 with herpes simplex replication-deficient vectors (HSVAPPsw). The expression of human APPsw was determined by Western blotting using the 6E10 antibody, which recognizes only human APP (Fig. 3A). On the next day the infected neurons were treated for 24 h with 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol and apoA-I, and Ab40 secretion was determined by ELISA. 22(R)-Hydroxycholesterol when combined with apoA-I decreased A40 secretion more than 5 times (Fig. 3B). T0901317 applied alone had a slightly smaller effect on A40 secretion (Fig. 3C) even without the addition of apoA-I. The effect of T0901317 on A42 secretion was less prominent thus confirming the data obtained with H4 cells. View larger version (16K): [in this window] [in a new window]  FIG. 3. LXR ligands decrease A secretion from primary neurons. A, primary neuronal cultures were made from dissociated cortices and hippocampi of 1718-day-old mouse embryos, and the neurons at day in vitro 4 were infected with HSV control virus (A, lane 1) or with HSVAPPsw (A, lanes 2 and 3) at multiplicity of infection 5. The expression of human full-length APP (hAPP) was determined 24 h later by Western blotting using the 6E10 antibody that recognizes only human APP. B, ELISA for A40. Neurons were infected as in A and treated with 10 M 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol (22R), and apoA-I was added in 20 mg/ml. Data (mean  S.E.) are the results of triplicate determinations from two experiments. C, primary neuronal cultures were made and infected as in A. Infected neurons were treated with 10 and 20 M T0901317 (T0) without apoA-I, and A40 and A42 secretion was determined by ELISA. Data (mean  S.E.) are the results of triplicate determinations from at least three experiments. *, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01; ***; p < 0.001 versus vehicle-treated control.  ABCA1 Overexpression in Transfection Experiments Decreases A SecretionTo determine whether the induction of ABCA1 might be responsible for a decreased secretion of A, we transiently transfected CHOAPPsw cells with ABCA1 and incubated cells with or without apoA-I. The transfection of ABCA1 resulted in expression levels of ABCA1 protein comparable with those induced by LXR/RXR activators (Fig. 4A, top panel) without affecting cellular APP levels (middle panel). Fig. 4B shows that overexpression of ABCA1 caused a statistically significant decrease in A40 levels, and the addition of apoA-I simultaneously to ABCA1 transfection caused a more than 2-fold decrease as compared with the mock-transfected cells. The overexpression of ABCA1 alone did not cause a statistically significant decrease in secretion of A42, although the addition of apoA-I resulted in a more than 4-fold decrease in A42 secretion. Therefore, the overexpression of ABCA1 decreased A secretion in a similar fashion as treatment with LXR/RXR ligands"

The protein expression level of ABCA1, APP, and -tubulin (-tub) were measured by Western blotting in the whole cell lysates (B), and A140 secretion was measured by ELISA in the conditioned media (C). Student's t test was used to determine significant difference in A40 levels. *, p < 0.05 and **, p < 0.01 compared with T0901317 only.  ApoA-I Treatment Increases the Effect of LXR Ligands on A SecretionTo examine the effect of apolipoprotein-mediated cholesterol efflux, we treated CHOAPPsw cells with increasing concentrations of T0901317 with or without the addition of apoA-I (Fig. 2A). Previously we have shown that treatment with apoA-I alone did not affect A secretion (22). Total A secretion was measured by Western blotting in aliquots of conditioned medium using the 6E10 antibody, which recognizes the first 16 amino acids of A peptide, and was normalized to the expression of intracellular APP. T0901317 at 2 M concentration had no effect on A production regardless of the addition of apoA-I (Fig. 2A). T0901317 at 5 and 10 M inhibited A secretion, and the addition of apoA-1 significantly increased the inhibitory effect of T0901317 as compared with cells without apoA-I (p < 0.01 and p < 0.05, respectively). The effect of apoA-I was confirmed in non-transfected human H4 cells expressing wild type APP treated with 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol. As visible from Fig. 2B, apoA-I and 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol treatment of H4 cells significantly decreased the secretion of total A. To examine how 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol and apoA-I affect the production of different A species, we measured A40 and A42 by ELISA. We found that A140 was decreased more than 5-fold but detected no change in A142. View larger version (24K): [in this window] [in a new window]  FIG. 2. ApoA-I treatment increases the effect of LXR ligands on A secretion. A, CHOAPPsw cells were treated for 24 h with increasing concentrations of LXR ligand T0901317 (T0) and with or without 20 g/ml apoA-I (T0+a). Total A secretion was measured by Western blotting in aliquots of the conditioned media using 6E10 antibody. The rightmost lane is a 5-ng load of A40 standard peptide (A40). Below is the quantification of the band intensity presented as a -fold of control after normalization to APP. Data (mean  S.E.) are the results of triplicate determinations from one experiment. **, p < 0.01 and ***, p < 0.001 compared with the vehicle-treated control. B, non-transfected H4 cells expressing wild type human APP were treated for 24 h with 10 M 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol, and cholesterol efflux was initiated by adding apoA-I (20 g/ml). Control cells were treated with vehicle only without apoA-I. Total A was immunoprecipitated from the medium using the 6E10 Ab, and the samples immunoblotted with the 6E10 Ab as described under ""Materials and Methods."" Immunoprecipitation of A from the medium of CHOAPPsw is shown for a comparison on the left. Lanes 1 and 2 are 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol-treated cells, and 3 and 4 are vehicle controls. C, non-transfected H4 cells were treated as in B, and A40 and A42 the were determined in conditioned medium by ELISA as described under ""Materials and Methods."" **, p < 0.01 versus vehicle-treated control.  LXR Ligands Inhibit APP Processing in Primary Neuronal CulturesTo examine the role of LXR/RXR ligands on neuronal processing of APPsw, we used primary neurons from cortices and hippocampi of embryonic mouse brains. The neurons, plated at high density (5 x 105/ml) in 12-well plates were infected at day in vitro 4 with herpes simplex replication-deficient vectors (HSVAPPsw). The expression of human APPsw was determined by Western blotting using the 6E10 antibody, which recognizes only human APP (Fig. 3A). On the next day the infected neurons were treated for 24 h with 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol and apoA-I, and Ab40 secretion was determined by ELISA. 22(R)-Hydroxycholesterol when combined with apoA-I decreased A40 secretion more than 5 times (Fig. 3B). T0901317 applied alone had a slightly smaller effect on A40 secretion (Fig. 3C) even without the addition of apoA-I. The effect of T0901317 on A42 secretion was less prominent thus confirming the data obtained with H4 cells. View larger version (16K): [in this window] [in a new window]  FIG. 3. LXR ligands decrease A secretion from primary neurons. A, primary neuronal cultures were made from dissociated cortices and hippocampi of 1718-day-old mouse embryos, and the neurons at day in vitro 4 were infected with HSV control virus (A, lane 1) or with HSVAPPsw (A, lanes 2 and 3) at multiplicity of infection 5. The expression of human full-length APP (hAPP) was determined 24 h later by Western blotting using the 6E10 antibody that recognizes only human APP. B, ELISA for A40. Neurons were infected as in A and treated with 10 M 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol (22R), and apoA-I was added in 20 mg/ml. Data (mean  S.E.) are the results of triplicate determinations from two experiments. C, primary neuronal cultures were made and infected as in A. Infected neurons were treated with 10 and 20 M T0901317 (T0) without apoA-I, and A40 and A42 secretion was determined by ELISA. Data (mean  S.E.) are the results of triplicate determinations from at least three experiments. *, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01; ***; p < 0.001 versus vehicle-treated control.  ABCA1 Overexpression in Transfection Experiments Decreases A SecretionTo determine whether the induction of ABCA1 might be responsible for a decreased secretion of A, we transiently transfected CHOAPPsw cells with ABCA1 and incubated cells with or without apoA-I. The transfection of ABCA1 resulted in expression levels of ABCA1 protein comparable with those induced by LXR/RXR activators (Fig. 4A, top panel) without affecting cellular APP levels (middle panel). Fig. 4B shows that overexpression of ABCA1 caused a statistically significant decrease in A40 levels, and the addition of apoA-I simultaneously to ABCA1 transfection caused a more than 2-fold decrease as compared with the mock-transfected cells. The overexpression of ABCA1 alone did not cause a statistically significant decrease in secretion of A42, although the addition of apoA-I resulted in a more than 4-fold decrease in A42 secretion. Therefore, the overexpression of ABCA1 decreased A secretion in a similar fashion as treatment with LXR/RXR ligands suggesting that the effect of the ligands could be mediated through ABCA1. View larger version (17K): [in this window] [in a new window]  FIG. 4. ABCA1 overexpression inhibits A secretion. A, Western blot for ABCA1, full-length APP, and -tubulin (B-tub) proteins in CHOAPPsw cells transiently transfected with empty vector (Lane 1, control) or recombinant vector for ABCA1 overexpression (lane 2). B and C, CHOAPPsw cells were transiently transfected as in A, and A40 and A42 levels in medium were measured by ELISA. A secretion was determined with (ABC + apo) or without the addition of apoA-I (ABC only). Data (mean  S.E.) are from two experiments in triplicate. *, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01 compared with mock control. A is normalized to total protein (TP).

The protein expression level of ABCA1, APP, and -tubulin (-tub) were measured by Western blotting in the whole cell lysates (B), and A140 secretion was measured by ELISA in the conditioned media (C). Student's t test was used to determine significant difference in A40 levels. *, p < 0.05 and **, p < 0.01 compared with T0901317 only.  ApoA-I Treatment Increases the Effect of LXR Ligands on A SecretionTo examine the effect of apolipoprotein-mediated cholesterol efflux, we treated CHOAPPsw cells with increasing concentrations of T0901317 with or without the addition of apoA-I (Fig. 2A). Previously we have shown that treatment with apoA-I alone did not affect A secretion (22). Total A secretion was measured by Western blotting in aliquots of conditioned medium using the 6E10 antibody, which recognizes the first 16 amino acids of A peptide, and was normalized to the expression of intracellular APP. T0901317 at 2 M concentration had no effect on A production regardless of the addition of apoA-I (Fig. 2A). T0901317 at 5 and 10 M inhibited A secretion, and the addition of apoA-1 significantly increased the inhibitory effect of T0901317 as compared with cells without apoA-I (p < 0.01 and p < 0.05, respectively). The effect of apoA-I was confirmed in non-transfected human H4 cells expressing wild type APP treated with 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol. As visible from Fig. 2B, apoA-I and 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol treatment of H4 cells significantly decreased the secretion of total A. To examine how 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol and apoA-I affect the production of different A species, we measured A40 and A42 by ELISA. We found that A140 was decreased more than 5-fold but detected no change in A142. View larger version (24K): [in this window] [in a new window]  FIG. 2. ApoA-I treatment increases the effect of LXR ligands on A secretion. A, CHOAPPsw cells were treated for 24 h with increasing concentrations of LXR ligand T0901317 (T0) and with or without 20 g/ml apoA-I (T0+a). Total A secretion was measured by Western blotting in aliquots of the conditioned media using 6E10 antibody. The rightmost lane is a 5-ng load of A40 standard peptide (A40). Below is the quantification of the band intensity presented as a -fold of control after normalization to APP. Data (mean  S.E.) are the results of triplicate determinations from one experiment. **, p < 0.01 and ***, p < 0.001 compared with the vehicle-treated control. B, non-transfected H4 cells expressing wild type human APP were treated for 24 h with 10 M 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol, and cholesterol efflux was initiated by adding apoA-I (20 g/ml). Control cells were treated with vehicle only without apoA-I. Total A was immunoprecipitated from the medium using the 6E10 Ab, and the samples immunoblotted with the 6E10 Ab as described under ""Materials and Methods."" Immunoprecipitation of A from the medium of CHOAPPsw is shown for a comparison on the left. Lanes 1 and 2 are 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol-treated cells, and 3 and 4 are vehicle controls. C, non-transfected H4 cells were treated as in B, and A40 and A42 the were determined in conditioned medium by ELISA as described under ""Materials and Methods."" **, p < 0.01 versus vehicle-treated control.  LXR Ligands Inhibit APP Processing in Primary Neuronal CulturesTo examine the role of LXR/RXR ligands on neuronal processing of APPsw, we used primary neurons from cortices and hippocampi of embryonic mouse brains. The neurons, plated at high density (5 x 105/ml) in 12-well plates were infected at day in vitro 4 with herpes simplex replication-deficient vectors (HSVAPPsw). The expression of human APPsw was determined by Western blotting using the 6E10 antibody, which recognizes only human APP (Fig. 3A). On the next day the infected neurons were treated for 24 h with 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol and apoA-I, and Ab40 secretion was determined by ELISA. 22(R)-Hydroxycholesterol when combined with apoA-I decreased A40 secretion more than 5 times (Fig. 3B). T0901317 applied alone had a slightly smaller effect on A40 secretion (Fig. 3C) even without the addition of apoA-I. The effect of T0901317 on A42 secretion was less prominent thus confirming the data obtained with H4 cells. View larger version (16K): [in this window] [in a new window]  FIG. 3. LXR ligands decrease A secretion from primary neurons. A, primary neuronal cultures were made from dissociated cortices and hippocampi of 1718-day-old mouse embryos, and the neurons at day in vitro 4 were infected with HSV control virus (A, lane 1) or with HSVAPPsw (A, lanes 2 and 3) at multiplicity of infection 5. The expression of human full-length APP (hAPP) was determined 24 h later by Western blotting using the 6E10 antibody that recognizes only human APP. B, ELISA for A40. Neurons were infected as in A and treated with 10 M 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol (22R), and apoA-I was added in 20 mg/ml. Data (mean  S.E.) are the results of triplicate determinations from two experiments. C, primary neuronal cultures were made and infected as in A. Infected neurons were treated with 10 and 20 M T0901317 (T0) without apoA-I, and A40 and A42 secretion was determined by ELISA. Data (mean  S.E.) are the results of triplicate determinations from at least three experiments. *, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01; ***; p < 0.001 versus vehicle-treated control.  ABCA1 Overexpression in Transfection Experiments Decreases A SecretionTo determine whether the induction of ABCA1 might be responsible for a decreased secretion of A, we transiently transfected CHOAPPsw cells with ABCA1 and incubated cells with or without apoA-I. The transfection of ABCA1 resulted in expression levels of ABCA1 protein comparable with those induced by LXR/RXR activators (Fig. 4A, top panel) without affecting cellular APP levels (middle panel). Fig. 4B shows that overexpression of ABCA1 caused a statistically significant decrease in A40 levels, and the addition of apoA-I simultaneously to ABCA1 transfection caused a more than 2-fold decrease as compared with the mock-transfected cells. The overexpression of ABCA1 alone did not cause a statistically significant decrease in secretion of A42, although the addition of apoA-I resulted in a more than 4-fold decrease in A42 secretion. Therefore, the overexpression of ABCA1 decreased A secretion in a similar fashion as treatment with LXR/RXR ligands suggesting that the effect of the ligands could be mediated through ABCA1. View larger version (17K): [in this window] [in a new window]  FIG. 4. ABCA1 overexpression inhibits A secretion. A, Western blot for ABCA1, full-length APP, and -tubulin (B-tub) proteins in CHOAPPsw cells transiently transfected with empty vector (Lane 1, control) or recombinant vector for ABCA1 overexpression (lane 2). B and C, CHOAPPsw cells were transiently transfected as in A, and A40 and A42 levels in medium were measured by ELISA. A secretion was determined with (ABC + apo) or without the addition of apoA-I (ABC only). Data (mean  S.E.) are from two experiments in triplicate. *, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01 compared with mock control. A is normalized to total protein (TP).  Mutations in ABCA1 Increase A SecretionNext we examined whether a functional ABCA1 protein was required for the effect of LXR/RXR ligands on A secretion. For these experiments we used permanent cell lines derived from Tangier patients. The TT1, TT2, and CT cell lines are telomerase immortalized skin fibroblasts from two Tangier patients and a control subject (30). TT1 was derived from T1 patient homozygous for an asparagine to serine amino acid substitution in exon 19 (AAT/AGT, amino acid position 935 of the primary translation product) resulting in the expression of full-length, albeit non-functional, protein (Fig. 5B, middle panel). The TT2 cell line was established from the T2 patient characterized by a homozygous 1-bp deletion in exon 1. This deletion introduces a stop codon at position 575, resulting in the omission of the majority of the ABCA1 protein sequence and expression of a truncated protein (Fig. 5B, bottom panel). First, we examined the basal level of A in medium from Tangier and control fibroblasts conditioned for 48 h without treatment. Fig. 5A demonstrates that the Tangier cell lines (TT1 and TT2) produced significantly more A40 as compared with normal fibroblasts (CT). In addition there was a statistically significant difference between Tangier cells, with TT2 secreting more A40 than TT1 cell line. Because the expression of endogenous APP in fibroblasts was very low we were not able to determine the secretion of A42. View larger version (26K): [in this window] [in a new window]  FIG. 5. T0901317 decreases A secretion in control but not in Tangier fibroblasts. A, the basal level of A40 in control (CT) and Tangier fibroblasts (TT1 and TT2) was determined by ELISA after a 48-h incubation in medium without ligands. **, p < 0.008 versus CT cells. Data (mean  S.E.) are the results from two experiments in triplicate. B, ABCA1 expression in CT, TT1, and TT2 cells. Cells were treated with vehicle (Veh) or 15 M T0901317 + 15 M retinoic acid (T0+RA), and the expression of ABCA1 was determined by Western blotting. The graph below represents the -fold increase in ABCA1 protein expression in CT and TT1 cells treated with vehicle () or ligands (). C and D, the Tangier and control fibroblasts were infected with HSVAPPsw as in Fig. 3, treated with 15 M T0901317 + 15 M retinoic acid () or vehicle () for 24 h, and A40 (C) and Ab42 (D) were determined by ELISA. For BD the results are the mean  S.E. from three experiments in triplicate. *, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01; ***, p < 0.001 versus vehicle-treated control.  To examine the effect of T0901317 on A40 and A42 secretion, Tangier fibroblasts were infected with HSVAPPsw and were treated with T0901317 and retinoic acid without apoA-I."

Phrase: "RXR ligands on neuronal processing of APPsw, we used primary neurons from cortices and hippocampi of embryonic mouse brains. The neurons, plated at high density (5 x 105/ml) in 12-well plates were infected at day in vitro 4 with herpes simplex replication-deficient vectors (HSVAPPsw). The expression of human APPsw was determined by Western blotting using the 6E10 antibody, which recognizes only human APP (Fig. 3A). On the next day the infected neurons were treated for 24 h with 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol and apoA-I, and Ab40 secretion was determined by ELISA. 22(R)-Hydroxycholesterol when combined with apoA-I decreased A40 secretion more than 5 times (Fig. 3B). T0901317 applied alone had a slightly smaller effect on A40 secretion (Fig. 3C) even without the addition of apoA-I. The effect of T0901317 on A42 secretion was less prominent thus confirming the data obtained with H4 cells. View larger version (16K): [in this window] [in a new window]  FIG. 3. LXR ligands decrease A secretion from primary neurons. A, primary neuronal cultures were made from dissociated cortices and hippocampi of 1718-day-old mouse embryos, and the neurons at day in vitro 4 were infected with HSV control virus (A, lane 1) or with HSVAPPsw (A, lanes 2 and 3) at multiplicity of infection 5. The expression of human full-length APP (hAPP) was determined 24 h later by Western blotting using the 6E10 antibody that recognizes only human APP. B, ELISA for A40. Neurons were infected as in A and treated with 10 M 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol (22R), and apoA-I was added in 20 mg/ml. Data (mean  S.E.) are the results of triplicate determinations from two experiments. C, primary neuronal cultures were made and infected as in A. Infected neurons were treated with 10 and 20 M T0901317 (T0) without apoA-I, and A40 and A42 secretion was determined by ELISA. Data (mean  S.E.) are the results of triplicate determinations from at least three experiments. *, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01; ***; p < 0.001 versus vehicle-treated control.  ABCA1 Overexpression in Transfection Experiments Decreases A SecretionTo determine whether the induction of ABCA1 might be responsible for a decreased secretion of A, we transiently transfected CHOAPPsw cells with ABCA1 and incubated cells with or without apoA-I. The transfection of ABCA1 resulted in expression levels of ABCA1 protein comparable with those induced by LXR/RXR activators (Fig. 4A, top panel) without affecting cellular APP levels (middle panel). Fig. 4B shows that overexpression of ABCA1 caused a statistically significant decrease in A40 levels, and the addition of apoA-I simultaneously to ABCA1 transfection caused a more than 2-fold decrease as compared with the mock-transfected cells. The overexpression of ABCA1 alone did not cause a statistically significant decrease in secretion of A42, although the addition of apoA-I resulted in a more than 4-fold decrease in A42 secretion. Therefore, the overexpression of ABCA1 decreased A secretion in a similar fashion as treatment with LXR/RXR ligands suggesting that the effect of the ligands could be mediated through ABCA1. View larger version (17K): [in this window] [in a new window]  FIG. 4. ABCA1 overexpression inhibits A secretion. A, Western blot for ABCA1, full-length APP, and -tubulin (B-tub) proteins in CHOAPPsw cells transiently transfected with empty vector (Lane 1, control) or recombinant vector for ABCA1 overexpression (lane 2). B and C, CHOAPPsw cells were transiently transfected as in A, and A40 and A42 levels in medium were measured by ELISA. A secretion was determined with (ABC + apo) or without the addition of apoA-I (ABC only). Data (mean  S.E.) are from two experiments in triplicate. *, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01 compared with mock control. A is normalized to total protein (TP).  Mutations in ABCA1 Increase A SecretionNext we examined whether a functional ABCA1 protein was required for the effect of LXR/RXR ligands on A secretion. For these experiments we used permanent cell lines derived from Tangier patients. The TT1, TT2, and CT cell lines are telomerase immortalized skin fibroblasts from two Tangier patients and a control subject (30). TT1 was derived from T1 patient homozygous for an asparagine to serine amino acid substitution in exon 19 (AAT/AGT, amino acid position 935 of the primary translation product) resulting in the expression of full-length, albeit non-functional, protein (Fig. 5B, middle panel). The TT2 cell line was established from the T2 patient characterized by a homozygous 1-bp deletion in exon 1. This deletion introduces a stop codon at position 575, resulting in the omission of the majority of the ABCA1 protein sequence and expression of a truncated protein (Fig. 5B, bottom panel). First, we examined the basal level of A in medium from Tangier and control fibroblasts conditioned for 48 h without treatment. Fig. 5A demonstrates that the Tangier cell lines (TT1 and TT2) produced significantly more A40 as compared with normal fibroblasts (CT). In addition there was a statistically significant difference between Tangier cells, with TT2 secreting more A40 than TT1 cell line. Because the expression of endogenous APP in fibroblasts was very low we were not able to determine the secretion of A42. View larger version (26K): [in this window] [in a new window]  FIG. 5. T0901317 decreases A secretion in control but not in Tangier fibroblasts. A, the basal level of A40 in control (CT) and Tangier fibroblasts (TT1 and TT2) was determined by ELISA after a 48-h incubation in medium without ligands. **, p < 0.008 versus CT cells. Data (mean  S.E.) are the results from two experiments in triplicate. B, ABCA1 expression in CT, TT1, and TT2 cells. Cells were treated with vehicle (Veh) or 15 M T0901317 + 15 M retinoic acid (T0+RA), and the expression of ABCA1 was determined by Western blotting. The graph below represents the -fold increase in ABCA1 protein expression in CT and TT1 cells treated with vehicle () or ligands (). C and D, the Tangier and control fibroblasts were infected with HSVAPPsw as in Fig. 3, treated with 15 M T0901317 + 15 M retinoic acid () or vehicle () for 24 h, and A40 (C) and Ab42 (D) were determined by ELISA. For BD the results are the mean  S.E. from three experiments in triplicate. *, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01; ***, p < 0.001 versus vehicle-treated control.  To examine the effect of T0901317 on A40 and A42 secretion, Tangier fibroblasts were infected with HSVAPPsw and were treated with T0901317 and retinoic acid without apoA-I. This treatment increased the expression of ABCA1 protein in CT and TT1 cells by 4- and 6-fold, respectively (Fig. 5B, top and middle panels). As expected there was not detectable ABCA1 protein in TT2 (Fig. 5B, bottom panel). The secretion of A40 and A42 was decreased only in the control fibroblasts and was not changed in TT2 cells (Fig. 5, C and D). The decrease in control fibroblasts was modest but statistically significant. Surprisingly, ligand treatment in TT1 cells induced a statistically significant increase in the secretion of amyloid beta (A40 and A42). The effect of T0901317 on control and Tangier cells was confirmed for A40 in non-infected cells expressing the endogenous APPwt (data not shown). Therefore, the existence of full-length functional ABCA1 is required to mediate the inhibitory effect of LXR/RXR ligands"

Phrase: "RXR ligands on neuronal processing of APPsw, we used primary neurons from cortices and hippocampi of embryonic mouse brains. The neurons, plated at high density (5 x 105/ml) in 12-well plates were infected at day in vitro 4 with herpes simplex replication-deficient vectors (HSVAPPsw). The expression of human APPsw was determined by Western blotting using the 6E10 antibody, which recognizes only human APP (Fig. 3A). On the next day the infected neurons were treated for 24 h with 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol and apoA-I, and Ab40 secretion was determined by ELISA. 22(R)-Hydroxycholesterol when combined with apoA-I decreased A40 secretion more than 5 times (Fig. 3B). T0901317 applied alone had a slightly smaller effect on A40 secretion (Fig. 3C) even without the addition of apoA-I. The effect of T0901317 on A42 secretion was less prominent thus confirming the data obtained with H4 cells. View larger version (16K): [in this window] [in a new window]  FIG. 3. LXR ligands decrease A secretion from primary neurons. A, primary neuronal cultures were made from dissociated cortices and hippocampi of 1718-day-old mouse embryos, and the neurons at day in vitro 4 were infected with HSV control virus (A, lane 1) or with HSVAPPsw (A, lanes 2 and 3) at multiplicity of infection 5. The expression of human full-length APP (hAPP) was determined 24 h later by Western blotting using the 6E10 antibody that recognizes only human APP. B, ELISA for A40. Neurons were infected as in A and treated with 10 M 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol (22R), and apoA-I was added in 20 mg/ml. Data (mean  S.E.) are the results of triplicate determinations from two experiments. C, primary neuronal cultures were made and infected as in A. Infected neurons were treated with 10 and 20 M T0901317 (T0) without apoA-I, and A40 and A42 secretion was determined by ELISA. Data (mean  S.E.) are the results of triplicate determinations from at least three experiments. *, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01; ***; p < 0.001 versus vehicle-treated control.  ABCA1 Overexpression in Transfection Experiments Decreases A SecretionTo determine whether the induction of ABCA1 might be responsible for a decreased secretion of A, we transiently transfected CHOAPPsw cells with ABCA1 and incubated cells with or without apoA-I. The transfection of ABCA1 resulted in expression levels of ABCA1 protein comparable with those induced by LXR/RXR activators (Fig. 4A, top panel) without affecting cellular APP levels (middle panel). Fig. 4B shows that overexpression of ABCA1 caused a statistically significant decrease in A40 levels, and the addition of apoA-I simultaneously to ABCA1 transfection caused a more than 2-fold decrease as compared with the mock-transfected cells. The overexpression of ABCA1 alone did not cause a statistically significant decrease in secretion of A42, although the addition of apoA-I resulted in a more than 4-fold decrease in A42 secretion. Therefore, the overexpression of ABCA1 decreased A secretion in a similar fashion as treatment with LXR/RXR ligands suggesting that the effect of the ligands could be mediated through ABCA1. View larger version (17K): [in this window] [in a new window]  FIG. 4. ABCA1 overexpression inhibits A secretion. A, Western blot for ABCA1, full-length APP, and -tubulin (B-tub) proteins in CHOAPPsw cells transiently transfected with empty vector (Lane 1, control) or recombinant vector for ABCA1 overexpression (lane 2). B and C, CHOAPPsw cells were transiently transfected as in A, and A40 and A42 levels in medium were measured by ELISA. A secretion was determined with (ABC + apo) or without the addition of apoA-I (ABC only). Data (mean  S.E.) are from two experiments in triplicate. *, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01 compared with mock control. A is normalized to total protein (TP).  Mutations in ABCA1 Increase A SecretionNext we examined whether a functional ABCA1 protein was required for the effect of LXR/RXR ligands on A secretion. For these experiments we used permanent cell lines derived from Tangier patients. The TT1, TT2, and CT cell lines are telomerase immortalized skin fibroblasts from two Tangier patients and a control subject (30). TT1 was derived from T1 patient homozygous for an asparagine to serine amino acid substitution in exon 19 (AAT/AGT, amino acid position 935 of the primary translation product) resulting in the expression of full-length, albeit non-functional, protein (Fig. 5B, middle panel). The TT2 cell line was established from the T2 patient characterized by a homozygous 1-bp deletion in exon 1. This deletion introduces a stop codon at position 575, resulting in the omission of the majority of the ABCA1 protein sequence and expression of a truncated protein (Fig. 5B, bottom panel). First, we examined the basal level of A in medium from Tangier and control fibroblasts conditioned for 48 h without treatment. Fig. 5A demonstrates that the Tangier cell lines (TT1 and TT2) produced significantly more A40 as compared with normal fibroblasts (CT). In addition there was a statistically significant difference between Tangier cells, with TT2 secreting more A40 than TT1 cell line. Because the expression of endogenous APP in fibroblasts was very low we were not able to determine the secretion of A42. View larger version (26K): [in this window] [in a new window]  FIG. 5. T0901317 decreases A secretion in control but not in Tangier fibroblasts. A, the basal level of A40 in control (CT) and Tangier fibroblasts (TT1 and TT2) was determined by ELISA after a 48-h incubation in medium without ligands. **, p < 0.008 versus CT cells. Data (mean  S.E.) are the results from two experiments in triplicate. B, ABCA1 expression in CT, TT1, and TT2 cells. Cells were treated with vehicle (Veh) or 15 M T0901317 + 15 M retinoic acid (T0+RA), and the expression of ABCA1 was determined by Western blotting. The graph below represents the -fold increase in ABCA1 protein expression in CT and TT1 cells treated with vehicle () or ligands (). C and D, the Tangier and control fibroblasts were infected with HSVAPPsw as in Fig. 3, treated with 15 M T0901317 + 15 M retinoic acid () or vehicle () for 24 h, and A40 (C) and Ab42 (D) were determined by ELISA. For BD the results are the mean  S.E. from three experiments in triplicate. *, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01; ***, p < 0.001 versus vehicle-treated control.  To examine the effect of T0901317 on A40 and A42 secretion, Tangier fibroblasts were infected with HSVAPPsw and were treated with T0901317 and retinoic acid without apoA-I. This treatment increased the expression of ABCA1 protein in CT and TT1 cells by 4- and 6-fold, respectively (Fig. 5B, top and middle panels). As expected there was not detectable ABCA1 protein in TT2 (Fig. 5B, bottom panel). The secretion of A40 and A42 was decreased only in the control fibroblasts and was not changed in TT2 cells (Fig. 5, C and D). The decrease in control fibroblasts was modest but statistically significant. Surprisingly, ligand treatment in TT1 cells induced a statistically significant increase in the secretion of amyloid beta (A40 and A42). The effect of T0901317 on control and Tangier cells was confirmed for A40 in non-infected cells expressing the endogenous APPwt (data not shown). Therefore, the existence of full-length functional ABCA1 is required to mediate the inhibitory effect of LXR/RXR ligands on A secretion. In Vivo LXR Ligand Treatment Increases Brain ABCA1 Expression and Influences Amyloidogenic Processing of Human APP in APP23 MiceTo examine the role of T0901317 on ABCA1 expression in vivo, we treated 11-week-old APP23 mice orally by gastric gavage for 6 days with 50 mg/kg/day T0901317. Control mice received vehicle only. The treatment of APP23 mice resulted in a substantial increase in the expression of ABCA1 (more than 3-fold, p < 0.001), whereas the expression of APP was unchanged (Fig. 6, A and B). View larger version (45K): [in this window] [in a new window]  FIG. 6. T0901317 increases the expression of ABCA1 in the brain and affects APP processing in APP23 mice.

To examine the effect of T0901317 on APP processing, we determined the amount of sAPP and sAPP by Western blotting. sAPP and sAPP were determined in diethylamine extracts, because this technique separates soluble A and sAPP from membrane-associated full-length APP and CTF resulting from - and -secretase cleavages (CTF and CTF). Fig. 6B (graph panel) shows that the ratio of sAPP- to -secretase cleavage product was significantly decreased after T0901317 treatment. This was in agreement with our previous in vitro data demonstrating that LXR ligands increase -secretase cleavage and sAPP secretion (22).

Phrase: "RXR ligands on neuronal processing of APPsw, we used primary neurons from cortices and hippocampi of embryonic mouse brains. The neurons, plated at high density (5 x 105/ml) in 12-well plates were infected at day in vitro 4 with herpes simplex replication-deficient vectors (HSVAPPsw). The expression of human APPsw was determined by Western blotting using the 6E10 antibody, which recognizes only human APP (Fig. 3A). On the next day the infected neurons were treated for 24 h with 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol and apoA-I, and Ab40 secretion was determined by ELISA. 22(R)-Hydroxycholesterol when combined with apoA-I decreased A40 secretion more than 5 times (Fig. 3B). T0901317 applied alone had a slightly smaller effect on A40 secretion (Fig. 3C) even without the addition of apoA-I. The effect of T0901317 on A42 secretion was less prominent thus confirming the data obtained with H4 cells. View larger version (16K): [in this window] [in a new window]  FIG. 3. LXR ligands decrease A secretion from primary neurons. A, primary neuronal cultures were made from dissociated cortices and hippocampi of 1718-day-old mouse embryos, and the neurons at day in vitro 4 were infected with HSV control virus (A, lane 1) or with HSVAPPsw (A, lanes 2 and 3) at multiplicity of infection 5. The expression of human full-length APP (hAPP) was determined 24 h later by Western blotting using the 6E10 antibody that recognizes only human APP. B, ELISA for A40. Neurons were infected as in A and treated with 10 M 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol (22R), and apoA-I was added in 20 mg/ml. Data (mean  S.E.) are the results of triplicate determinations from two experiments. C, primary neuronal cultures were made and infected as in A. Infected neurons were treated with 10 and 20 M T0901317 (T0) without apoA-I, and A40 and A42 secretion was determined by ELISA. Data (mean  S.E.) are the results of triplicate determinations from at least three experiments. *, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01; ***; p < 0.001 versus vehicle-treated control.  ABCA1 Overexpression in Transfection Experiments Decreases A SecretionTo determine whether the induction of ABCA1 might be responsible for a decreased secretion of A, we transiently transfected CHOAPPsw cells with ABCA1 and incubated cells with or without apoA-I. The transfection of ABCA1 resulted in expression levels of ABCA1 protein comparable with those induced by LXR/RXR activators (Fig. 4A, top panel) without affecting cellular APP levels (middle panel). Fig. 4B shows that overexpression of ABCA1 caused a statistically significant decrease in A40 levels, and the addition of apoA-I simultaneously to ABCA1 transfection caused a more than 2-fold decrease as compared with the mock-transfected cells. The overexpression of ABCA1 alone did not cause a statistically significant decrease in secretion of A42, although the addition of apoA-I resulted in a more than 4-fold decrease in A42 secretion. Therefore, the overexpression of ABCA1 decreased A secretion in a similar fashion as treatment with LXR/RXR ligands suggesting that the effect of the ligands could be mediated through ABCA1. View larger version (17K): [in this window] [in a new window]  FIG. 4. ABCA1 overexpression inhibits A secretion. A, Western blot for ABCA1, full-length APP, and -tubulin (B-tub) proteins in CHOAPPsw cells transiently transfected with empty vector (Lane 1, control) or recombinant vector for ABCA1 overexpression (lane 2). B and C, CHOAPPsw cells were transiently transfected as in A, and A40 and A42 levels in medium were measured by ELISA. A secretion was determined with (ABC + apo) or without the addition of apoA-I (ABC only). Data (mean  S.E.) are from two experiments in triplicate. *, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01 compared with mock control. A is normalized to total protein (TP).  Mutations in ABCA1 Increase A SecretionNext we examined whether a functional ABCA1 protein was required for the effect of LXR/RXR ligands on A secretion. For these experiments we used permanent cell lines derived from Tangier patients. The TT1, TT2, and CT cell lines are telomerase immortalized skin fibroblasts from two Tangier patients and a control subject (30). TT1 was derived from T1 patient homozygous for an asparagine to serine amino acid substitution in exon 19 (AAT/AGT, amino acid position 935 of the primary translation product) resulting in the expression of full-length, albeit non-functional, protein (Fig. 5B, middle panel). The TT2 cell line was established from the T2 patient characterized by a homozygous 1-bp deletion in exon 1. This deletion introduces a stop codon at position 575, resulting in the omission of the majority of the ABCA1 protein sequence and expression of a truncated protein (Fig. 5B, bottom panel). First, we examined the basal level of A in medium from Tangier and control fibroblasts conditioned for 48 h without treatment. Fig. 5A demonstrates that the Tangier cell lines (TT1 and TT2) produced significantly more A40 as compared with normal fibroblasts (CT). In addition there was a statistically significant difference between Tangier cells, with TT2 secreting more A40 than TT1 cell line. Because the expression of endogenous APP in fibroblasts was very low we were not able to determine the secretion of A42. View larger version (26K): [in this window] [in a new window]  FIG. 5. T0901317 decreases A secretion in control but not in Tangier fibroblasts. A, the basal level of A40 in control (CT) and Tangier fibroblasts (TT1 and TT2) was determined by ELISA after a 48-h incubation in medium without ligands. **, p < 0.008 versus CT cells. Data (mean  S.E.) are the results from two experiments in triplicate. B, ABCA1 expression in CT, TT1, and TT2 cells. Cells were treated with vehicle (Veh) or 15 M T0901317 + 15 M retinoic acid (T0+RA), and the expression of ABCA1 was determined by Western blotting. The graph below represents the -fold increase in ABCA1 protein expression in CT and TT1 cells treated with vehicle () or ligands (). C and D, the Tangier and control fibroblasts were infected with HSVAPPsw as in Fig. 3, treated with 15 M T0901317 + 15 M retinoic acid () or vehicle () for 24 h, and A40 (C) and Ab42 (D) were determined by ELISA. For BD the results are the mean  S.E. from three experiments in triplicate. *, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01; ***, p < 0.001 versus vehicle-treated control.  To examine the effect of T0901317 on A40 and A42 secretion, Tangier fibroblasts were infected with HSVAPPsw and were treated with T0901317 and retinoic acid without apoA-I. This treatment increased the expression of ABCA1 protein in CT and TT1 cells by 4- and 6-fold, respectively (Fig. 5B, top and middle panels). As expected there was not detectable ABCA1 protein in TT2 (Fig. 5B, bottom panel). The secretion of A40 and A42 was decreased only in the control fibroblasts and was not changed in TT2 cells (Fig. 5, C and D). The decrease in control fibroblasts was modest but statistically significant. Surprisingly, ligand treatment in TT1 cells induced a statistically significant increase in the secretion of amyloid beta (A40 and A42). The effect of T0901317 on control and Tangier cells was confirmed for A40 in non-infected cells expressing the endogenous APPwt (data not shown). Therefore, the existence of full-length functional ABCA1 is required to mediate the inhibitory effect of LXR/RXR ligands on A secretion. In Vivo LXR Ligand Treatment Increases Brain ABCA1 Expression and Influences Amyloidogenic Processing of Human APP in APP23 MiceTo examine the role of T0901317 on ABCA1 expression in vivo, we treated 11-week-old APP23 mice orally by gastric gavage for 6 days with 50 mg/kg/day T0901317. Control mice received vehicle only. The treatment of APP23 mice resulted in a substantial increase in the expression of ABCA1 (more than 3-fold, p < 0.001), whereas the expression of APP was unchanged (Fig. 6, A and B). View larger version (45K): [in this window] [in a new window]  FIG. 6. T0901317 increases the expression of ABCA1 in the brain and affects APP processing in APP23 mice. T0901317 (T0) (50 mg/kg/day) was applied for 6 days to 11-week-old APP23 mice. A, the expression of ABCA1 after T0901317 treatment was examined by Western blotting. Quantification of ABCA1 protein level, normalized to the level of -tubulin expression is presented below. B, the levels of sAPP and sAPP were determined by Western blotting, and bands quantified and presented as the ratio of sAPP/sAPP. C, Western blotting of CTF and CTF. Quantification of CTF and CTF, normalized for APP expression is presented below. D, Western blotting for apoE after T0901317 treatment. The expression level of apoE is normalized to the expression level of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). Data are mean  S.E., n = 10 mice/group. Veh, vehicle.  To examine the effect of T0901317 on APP processing, we determined the amount of sAPP and sAPP by Western blotting. sAPP and sAPP were determined in diethylamine extracts, because this technique separates soluble A and sAPP from membrane-associated full-length APP and CTF resulting from - and -secretase cleavages (CTF and CTF). Fig. 6B (graph panel) shows that the ratio of sAPP- to -secretase cleavage product was significantly decreased after T0901317 treatment. This was in agreement with our previous in vitro data demonstrating that LXR ligands increase -secretase cleavage and sAPP secretion (22). T0901317 did not induce a significant change in the level of CTFs (Fig. 6C), which was in contrast with the in vitro effect of LXR/RXR ligands (22). Because LXR/RXR ligands are known to regulate the expression of apoE, we also examined the level of apoE protein in brain homogenates after T0901317 treatment. As visible from Fig. 6D the ligand treatment did not cause significant change in the apoE protein level. Finally we examined the effect of T0901317 on A production. Because at this age A in the brain of APP23 mice is soluble in SDS, A was extracted from the initial brain homogenate by SDS containing RIPA buffer or diethylamine, and the results from the two determinations compared. Fig. 7, A and B show the levels of RIPA-extracted A40 and A42 in APP23 mice were significantly decreased. Similar results were obtained by ELISA determinations of diethylamine-extracted soluble A40 and A42 (not shown), thus confirming that amyloidogenic processing of human APP in APP23 mice was decreased after T0901317 treatment.

DISCUSSION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION MATERIALS AND METHODS RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES  Epidemiological data suggest that vascular risk factors such as high blood pressure and high total plasma cholesterol (1, 2) increase the risk not only for vascular dementia but also for late onset Alzheimer's disease (4, 7). In addition, low HDL cholesterol and serum apoA-I concentrations are highly correlated with the severity of AD (5, 9, 10). In mice overexpressing human APPsw, diet-induced hypercholesterolemia correlated with brain A deposits (34). The amyloid burden correlated inversely with plasma levels of HDL (35). ABCA1 is a major regulator of cholesterol efflux and HDL metabolism, and its transcriptional activation is controlled by nuclear liver X receptors and . A detailed examination of LXR double knockout mice has shown that LXRs have an important function not only in lipid homeostasis in the brain, but that the loss of these receptors results in neurodegenerative disease (36). Recently, we and others showed (2224) that ligands for LXR/ increased ABCA1 expression in neuronal cells and reduced A secretion. In the present study, we examined the effect of the synthetic LXR ligand T0901317 in vitro and in vivo in a mouse model for AD. To examine the effect of T0901317 on APP processing in vitro, we used non-neuronal and neuronal cell lines and primary neuronal culture. In all these models T0901317 increased ABCA1 expression and decreased A secretion, confirming our previous results with hydroxysterols. Furthermore, apoA-I led to an additional decrease in secreted A, suggesting that lipid efflux and related decrease in intracellular cholesterol concentration are important factors in APP processing. Several important observations should be noted, however. Although the increase in ABCA1 expression caused by LXR/RXR"

Phrase: "RXR ligands on neuronal processing of APPsw, we used primary neurons from cortices and hippocampi of embryonic mouse brains. The neurons, plated at high density (5 x 105/ml) in 12-well plates were infected at day in vitro 4 with herpes simplex replication-deficient vectors (HSVAPPsw). The expression of human APPsw was determined by Western blotting using the 6E10 antibody, which recognizes only human APP (Fig. 3A). On the next day the infected neurons were treated for 24 h with 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol and apoA-I, and Ab40 secretion was determined by ELISA. 22(R)-Hydroxycholesterol when combined with apoA-I decreased A40 secretion more than 5 times (Fig. 3B). T0901317 applied alone had a slightly smaller effect on A40 secretion (Fig. 3C) even without the addition of apoA-I. The effect of T0901317 on A42 secretion was less prominent thus confirming the data obtained with H4 cells. View larger version (16K): [in this window] [in a new window]  FIG. 3. LXR ligands decrease A secretion from primary neurons. A, primary neuronal cultures were made from dissociated cortices and hippocampi of 1718-day-old mouse embryos, and the neurons at day in vitro 4 were infected with HSV control virus (A, lane 1) or with HSVAPPsw (A, lanes 2 and 3) at multiplicity of infection 5. The expression of human full-length APP (hAPP) was determined 24 h later by Western blotting using the 6E10 antibody that recognizes only human APP. B, ELISA for A40.

Infected neurons were treated with 10 and 20 M T0901317 (T0) without apoA-I, and A40 and A42 secretion was determined by ELISA. Data (mean  S.E.) are the results of triplicate determinations from at least three experiments. *, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01; ***; p < 0.001 versus vehicle-treated control.  ABCA1 Overexpression in Transfection Experiments Decreases A SecretionTo determine whether the induction of ABCA1 might be responsible for a decreased secretion of A, we transiently transfected CHOAPPsw cells with ABCA1 and incubated cells with or without apoA-I. The transfection of ABCA1 resulted in expression levels of ABCA1 protein comparable with those induced by LXR/RXR activators (Fig. 4A, top panel) without affecting cellular APP levels (middle panel). Fig. 4B shows that overexpression of ABCA1 caused a statistically significant decrease in A40 levels, and the addition of apoA-I simultaneously to ABCA1 transfection caused a more than 2-fold decrease as compared with the mock-transfected cells. The overexpression of ABCA1 alone did not cause a statistically significant decrease in secretion of A42, although the addition of apoA-I resulted in a more than 4-fold decrease in A42 secretion. Therefore, the overexpression of ABCA1 decreased A secretion in a similar fashion as treatment with LXR/RXR ligands suggesting that the effect of the ligands could be mediated through ABCA1. View larger version (17K): [in this window] [in a new window]  FIG. 4. ABCA1 overexpression inhibits A secretion. A, Western blot for ABCA1, full-length APP, and -tubulin (B-tub) proteins in CHOAPPsw cells transiently transfected with empty vector (Lane 1, control) or recombinant vector for ABCA1 overexpression (lane 2). B and C, CHOAPPsw cells were transiently transfected as in A, and A40 and A42 levels in medium were measured by ELISA. A secretion was determined with (ABC + apo) or without the addition of apoA-I (ABC only). Data (mean  S.E.) are from two experiments in triplicate. *, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01 compared with mock control. A is normalized to total protein (TP).  Mutations in ABCA1 Increase A SecretionNext we examined whether a functional ABCA1 protein was required for the effect of LXR/RXR ligands on A secretion. For these experiments we used permanent cell lines derived from Tangier patients. The TT1, TT2, and CT cell lines are telomerase immortalized skin fibroblasts from two Tangier patients and a control subject (30). TT1 was derived from T1 patient homozygous for an asparagine to serine amino acid substitution in exon 19 (AAT/AGT, amino acid position 935 of the primary translation product) resulting in the expression of full-length, albeit non-functional, protein (Fig. 5B, middle panel). The TT2 cell line was established from the T2 patient characterized by a homozygous 1-bp deletion in exon 1. This deletion introduces a stop codon at position 575, resulting in the omission of the majority of the ABCA1 protein sequence and expression of a truncated protein (Fig. 5B, bottom panel). First, we examined the basal level of A in medium from Tangier and control fibroblasts conditioned for 48 h without treatment. Fig. 5A demonstrates that the Tangier cell lines (TT1 and TT2) produced significantly more A40 as compared with normal fibroblasts (CT). In addition there was a statistically significant difference between Tangier cells, with TT2 secreting more A40 than TT1 cell line. Because the expression of endogenous APP in fibroblasts was very low we were not able to determine the secretion of A42. View larger version (26K): [in this window] [in a new window]  FIG. 5. T0901317 decreases A secretion in control but not in Tangier fibroblasts. A, the basal level of A40 in control (CT) and Tangier fibroblasts (TT1 and TT2) was determined by ELISA after a 48-h incubation in medium without ligands. **, p < 0.008 versus CT cells. Data (mean  S.E.) are the results from two experiments in triplicate. B, ABCA1 expression in CT, TT1, and TT2 cells. Cells were treated with vehicle (Veh) or 15 M T0901317 + 15 M retinoic acid (T0+RA), and the expression of ABCA1 was determined by Western blotting. The graph below represents the -fold increase in ABCA1 protein expression in CT and TT1 cells treated with vehicle () or ligands (). C and D, the Tangier and control fibroblasts were infected with HSVAPPsw as in Fig. 3, treated with 15 M T0901317 + 15 M retinoic acid () or vehicle () for 24 h, and A40 (C) and Ab42 (D) were determined by ELISA. For BD the results are the mean  S.E. from three experiments in triplicate. *, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01; ***, p < 0.001 versus vehicle-treated control.  To examine the effect of T0901317 on A40 and A42 secretion, Tangier fibroblasts were infected with HSVAPPsw and were treated with T0901317 and retinoic acid without apoA-I. This treatment increased the expression of ABCA1 protein in CT and TT1 cells by 4- and 6-fold, respectively (Fig. 5B, top and middle panels). As expected there was not detectable ABCA1 protein in TT2 (Fig. 5B, bottom panel). The secretion of A40 and A42 was decreased only in the control fibroblasts and was not changed in TT2 cells (Fig. 5, C and D). The decrease in control fibroblasts was modest but statistically significant. Surprisingly, ligand treatment in TT1 cells induced a statistically significant increase in the secretion of amyloid beta (A40 and A42). The effect of T0901317 on control and Tangier cells was confirmed for A40 in non-infected cells expressing the endogenous APPwt (data not shown). Therefore, the existence of full-length functional ABCA1 is required to mediate the inhibitory effect of LXR/RXR ligands on A secretion. In Vivo LXR Ligand Treatment Increases Brain ABCA1 Expression and Influences Amyloidogenic Processing of Human APP in APP23 MiceTo examine the role of T0901317 on ABCA1 expression in vivo, we treated 11-week-old APP23 mice orally by gastric gavage for 6 days with 50 mg/kg/day T0901317. Control mice received vehicle only. The treatment of APP23 mice resulted in a substantial increase in the expression of ABCA1 (more than 3-fold, p < 0.001), whereas the expression of APP was unchanged (Fig. 6, A and B). View larger version (45K): [in this window] [in a new window]  FIG. 6. T0901317 increases the expression of ABCA1 in the brain and affects APP processing in APP23 mice. T0901317 (T0) (50 mg/kg/day) was applied for 6 days to 11-week-old APP23 mice. A, the expression of ABCA1 after T0901317 treatment was examined by Western blotting. Quantification of ABCA1 protein level, normalized to the level of -tubulin expression is presented below. B, the levels of sAPP and sAPP were determined by Western blotting, and bands quantified and presented as the ratio of sAPP/sAPP. C, Western blotting of CTF and CTF. Quantification of CTF and CTF, normalized for APP expression is presented below. D, Western blotting for apoE after T0901317 treatment. The expression level of apoE is normalized to the expression level of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). Data are mean  S.E., n = 10 mice/group. Veh, vehicle.  To examine the effect of T0901317 on APP processing, we determined the amount of sAPP and sAPP by Western blotting. sAPP and sAPP were determined in diethylamine extracts, because this technique separates soluble A and sAPP from membrane-associated full-length APP and CTF resulting from - and -secretase cleavages (CTF and CTF). Fig. 6B (graph panel) shows that the ratio of sAPP- to -secretase cleavage product was significantly decreased after T0901317 treatment. This was in agreement with our previous in vitro data demonstrating that LXR ligands increase -secretase cleavage and sAPP secretion (22). T0901317 did not induce a significant change in the level of CTFs (Fig. 6C), which was in contrast with the in vitro effect of LXR/RXR ligands (22). Because LXR/RXR ligands are known to regulate the expression of apoE, we also examined the level of apoE protein in brain homogenates after T0901317 treatment. As visible from Fig. 6D the ligand treatment did not cause significant change in the apoE protein level. Finally we examined the effect of T0901317 on A production. Because at this age A in the brain of APP23 mice is soluble in SDS, A was extracted from the initial brain homogenate by SDS containing RIPA buffer or diethylamine, and the results from the two determinations compared. Fig. 7, A and B show the levels of RIPA-extracted A40 and A42 in APP23 mice were significantly decreased. Similar results were obtained by ELISA determinations of diethylamine-extracted soluble A40 and A42 (not shown), thus confirming that amyloidogenic processing of human APP in APP23 mice was decreased after T0901317 treatment.

DISCUSSION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION MATERIALS AND METHODS RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES  Epidemiological data suggest that vascular risk factors such as high blood pressure and high total plasma cholesterol (1, 2) increase the risk not only for vascular dementia but also for late onset Alzheimer's disease (4, 7). In addition, low HDL cholesterol and serum apoA-I concentrations are highly correlated with the severity of AD (5, 9, 10). In mice overexpressing human APPsw, diet-induced hypercholesterolemia correlated with brain A deposits (34). The amyloid burden correlated inversely with plasma levels of HDL (35). ABCA1 is a major regulator of cholesterol efflux and HDL metabolism, and its transcriptional activation is controlled by nuclear liver X receptors and . A detailed examination of LXR double knockout mice has shown that LXRs have an important function not only in lipid homeostasis in the brain, but that the loss of these receptors results in neurodegenerative disease (36). Recently, we and others showed (2224) that ligands for LXR/ increased ABCA1 expression in neuronal cells and reduced A secretion. In the present study, we examined the effect of the synthetic LXR ligand T0901317 in vitro and in vivo in a mouse model for AD. To examine the effect of T0901317 on APP processing in vitro, we used non-neuronal and neuronal cell lines and primary neuronal culture. In all these models T0901317 increased ABCA1 expression and decreased A secretion, confirming our previous results with hydroxysterols. Furthermore, apoA-I led to an additional decrease in secreted A, suggesting that lipid efflux and related decrease in intracellular cholesterol concentration are important factors in APP processing. Several important observations should be noted, however. Although the increase in ABCA1 expression caused by LXR/RXR was comparable in primary neurons and non-neuronal cells, there were cell-type-specific differences in the magnitude of T0901317-induced effect on A secretion. Ligand-mediated suppression of A secretion was robust in primary neurons and neuronal cell lines but much less pronounced in fibroblasts suggesting that additional tissue specific factors are needed to mediate the LXRs/ABCA1 effect on A secretion. The experiments with Tangier fibroblasts, which lack a functional ABCA1 protein, clearly demonstrated that ABCA1 affects APP processing. The fact that A secretion was lower in control fibroblasts than in Tangier cells demonstrates that the decrease in A is related to an intrinsic cellular activity of ABCA1.

Phrase: "LXR/RXR was comparable in primary neurons and non-neuronal cells, there were cell-type-specific differences in the magnitude of T0901317-induced effect on A secretion. Ligand-mediated suppression of A secretion was robust in primary neurons and neuronal cell lines but much less pronounced in fibroblasts suggesting that additional tissue specific factors are needed to mediate the LXRs/ABCA1 effect on A secretion. The experiments with Tangier fibroblasts, which lack a functional ABCA1 protein, clearly demonstrated that ABCA1 affects APP processing. The fact that A secretion was lower in control fibroblasts than in Tangier cells demonstrates that the decrease in A is related to an intrinsic cellular activity of ABCA1. Furthermore, the effect of LXR/RXR ligands required a functional ABCA1 (absent in both Tangier cell lines) to affect A secretion. We were surprised, however, to find that T0901317 increased A secretion in TT1 cell line, which expresses a full-length but non-functional ABCA1 protein. It is possible that increased expression of a non-functional ABCA1 has a dominant negative effect on another cellular component that limits the secretion of A. If so, ABCA1 may function as part of a multicomponent complex that inhibits the secretion of A. The amino acid substitution in TT1 (asparagine to serine) affects the conserved Walker A motif of the N-terminal ATP binding fold. This domain may affect ATP binding and hydrolysis but may also be critical for functional interactions of ABCA1 with intracellular effector molecules and components involved in trafficking and secretion. For example, Rac1, which is a key regulator in the secretion of the non-amyloidogenic sAPP (37), was shown to accumulate in primary fibroblasts of the T1 pedigree (38). It is conceivable that a mutant ABCA1 may affect such protein and that a point mutation may result in a more severe phenotype than complete ABCA1 deficiency. In this context, it is interesting to note that one of the two homozygous Tangier disease patients of the T1 pedigree developed signs of severe dementia and amyloid depositions at age 60.2 However, none of the three homozygous Tangier patients of the T2 family have signs of dementia. By contrast, the asparagine to serine mutation of T1 is apparently not associated with premature atherosclerosis (39), whereas all three homozygous patients of the T2 pedigree suffer from severe premature atherosclerosis (30).

Phrase: "RXR ligands on neuronal processing of APPsw, we used primary neurons from cortices and hippocampi of embryonic mouse brains. The neurons, plated at high density (5 x 105/ml) in 12-well plates were infected at day in vitro 4 with herpes simplex replication-deficient vectors (HSVAPPsw). The expression of human APPsw was determined by Western blotting using the 6E10 antibody, which recognizes only human APP (Fig. 3A). On the next day the infected neurons were treated for 24 h with 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol and apoA-I, and Ab40 secretion was determined by ELISA. 22(R)-Hydroxycholesterol when combined with apoA-I decreased A40 secretion more than 5 times (Fig. 3B). T0901317 applied alone had a slightly smaller effect on A40 secretion (Fig. 3C) even without the addition of apoA-I.

ABCA1 Overexpression in Transfection Experiments Decreases A SecretionTo determine whether the induction of ABCA1 might be responsible for a decreased secretion of A, we transiently transfected CHOAPPsw cells with ABCA1 and incubated cells with or without apoA-I. The transfection of ABCA1 resulted in expression levels of ABCA1 protein comparable with those induced by LXR/RXR activators (Fig. 4A, top panel) without affecting cellular APP levels (middle panel). Fig. 4B shows that overexpression of ABCA1 caused a statistically significant decrease in A40 levels, and the addition of apoA-I simultaneously to ABCA1 transfection caused a more than 2-fold decrease as compared with the mock-transfected cells. The overexpression of ABCA1 alone did not cause a statistically significant decrease in secretion of A42, although the addition of apoA-I resulted in a more than 4-fold decrease in A42 secretion. Therefore, the overexpression of ABCA1 decreased A secretion in a similar fashion as treatment with LXR/RXR ligands suggesting that the effect of the ligands could be mediated through ABCA1.

B and C, CHOAPPsw cells were transiently transfected as in A, and A40 and A42 levels in medium were measured by ELISA. A secretion was determined with (ABC + apo) or without the addition of apoA-I (ABC only). Data (mean  S.E.) are from two experiments in triplicate. *, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01 compared with mock control. A is normalized to total protein (TP).  Mutations in ABCA1 Increase A SecretionNext we examined whether a functional ABCA1 protein was required for the effect of LXR/RXR ligands on A secretion. For these experiments we used permanent cell lines derived from Tangier patients. The TT1, TT2, and CT cell lines are telomerase immortalized skin fibroblasts from two Tangier patients and a control subject (30). TT1 was derived from T1 patient homozygous for an asparagine to serine amino acid substitution in exon 19 (AAT/AGT, amino acid position 935 of the primary translation product) resulting in the expression of full-length, albeit non-functional, protein (Fig. 5B, middle panel). The TT2 cell line was established from the T2 patient characterized by a homozygous 1-bp deletion in exon 1. This deletion introduces a stop codon at position 575, resulting in the omission of the majority of the ABCA1 protein sequence and expression of a truncated protein (Fig. 5B, bottom panel). First, we examined the basal level of A in medium from Tangier and control fibroblasts conditioned for 48 h without treatment. Fig. 5A demonstrates that the Tangier cell lines (TT1 and TT2) produced significantly more A40 as compared with normal fibroblasts (CT). In addition there was a statistically significant difference between Tangier cells, with TT2 secreting more A40 than TT1 cell line. Because the expression of endogenous APP in fibroblasts was very low we were not able to determine the secretion of A42. View larger version (26K): [in this window] [in a new window]  FIG. 5.

For BD the results are the mean  S.E. from three experiments in triplicate. *, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01; ***, p < 0.001 versus vehicle-treated control.  To examine the effect of T0901317 on A40 and A42 secretion, Tangier fibroblasts were infected with HSVAPPsw and were treated with T0901317 and retinoic acid without apoA-I. This treatment increased the expression of ABCA1 protein in CT and TT1 cells by 4- and 6-fold, respectively (Fig. 5B, top and middle panels). As expected there was not detectable ABCA1 protein in TT2 (Fig. 5B, bottom panel). The secretion of A40 and A42 was decreased only in the control fibroblasts and was not changed in TT2 cells (Fig. 5, C and D). The decrease in control fibroblasts was modest but statistically significant. Surprisingly, ligand treatment in TT1 cells induced a statistically significant increase in the secretion of amyloid beta (A40 and A42). The effect of T0901317 on control and Tangier cells was confirmed for A40 in non-infected cells expressing the endogenous APPwt (data not shown). Therefore, the existence of full-length functional ABCA1 is required to mediate the inhibitory effect of LXR/RXR ligands on A secretion. In Vivo LXR Ligand Treatment Increases Brain ABCA1 Expression and Influences Amyloidogenic Processing of Human APP in APP23 MiceTo examine the role of T0901317 on ABCA1 expression in vivo, we treated 11-week-old APP23 mice orally by gastric gavage for 6 days with 50 mg/kg/day T0901317. Control mice received vehicle only. The treatment of APP23 mice resulted in a substantial increase in the expression of ABCA1 (more than 3-fold, p < 0.001), whereas the expression of APP was unchanged (Fig. 6, A and B).

To examine the effect of T0901317 on APP processing, we determined the amount of sAPP and sAPP by Western blotting. sAPP and sAPP were determined in diethylamine extracts, because this technique separates soluble A and sAPP from membrane-associated full-length APP and CTF resulting from - and -secretase cleavages (CTF and CTF). Fig. 6B (graph panel) shows that the ratio of sAPP- to -secretase cleavage product was significantly decreased after T0901317 treatment. This was in agreement with our previous in vitro data demonstrating that LXR ligands increase -secretase cleavage and sAPP secretion (22). T0901317 did not induce a significant change in the level of CTFs (Fig. 6C), which was in contrast with the in vitro effect of LXR/RXR ligands (22). Because LXR/RXR ligands are known to regulate the expression of apoE, we also examined the level of apoE protein in brain homogenates after T0901317 treatment. As visible from Fig. 6D the ligand treatment did not cause significant change in the apoE protein level. Finally we examined the effect of T0901317 on A production. Because at this age A in the brain of APP23 mice is soluble in SDS, A was extracted from the initial brain homogenate by SDS containing RIPA buffer or diethylamine, and the results from the two determinations compared. Fig. 7, A and B show the levels of RIPA-extracted A40 and A42 in APP23 mice were significantly decreased. Similar results were obtained by ELISA determinations of diethylamine-extracted soluble A40 and A42 (not shown), thus confirming that amyloidogenic processing of human APP in APP23 mice was decreased after T0901317 treatment.

DISCUSSION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION MATERIALS AND METHODS RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES  Epidemiological data suggest that vascular risk factors such as high blood pressure and high total plasma cholesterol (1, 2) increase the risk not only for vascular dementia but also for late onset Alzheimer's disease (4, 7). In addition, low HDL cholesterol and serum apoA-I concentrations are highly correlated with the severity of AD (5, 9, 10). In mice overexpressing human APPsw, diet-induced hypercholesterolemia correlated with brain A deposits (34). The amyloid burden correlated inversely with plasma levels of HDL (35). ABCA1 is a major regulator of cholesterol efflux and HDL metabolism, and its transcriptional activation is controlled by nuclear liver X receptors and . A detailed examination of LXR double knockout mice has shown that LXRs have an important function not only in lipid homeostasis in the brain, but that the loss of these receptors results in neurodegenerative disease (36). Recently, we and others showed (2224) that ligands for LXR/ increased ABCA1 expression in neuronal cells and reduced A secretion. In the present study, we examined the effect of the synthetic LXR ligand T0901317 in vitro and in vivo in a mouse model for AD. To examine the effect of T0901317 on APP processing in vitro, we used non-neuronal and neuronal cell lines and primary neuronal culture. In all these models T0901317 increased ABCA1 expression and decreased A secretion, confirming our previous results with hydroxysterols. Furthermore, apoA-I led to an additional decrease in secreted A, suggesting that lipid efflux and related decrease in intracellular cholesterol concentration are important factors in APP processing. Several important observations should be noted, however. Although the increase in ABCA1 expression caused by LXR/RXR was comparable in primary neurons and non-neuronal cells, there were cell-type-specific differences in the magnitude of T0901317-induced effect on A secretion. Ligand-mediated suppression of A secretion was robust in primary neurons and neuronal cell lines but much less pronounced in fibroblasts suggesting that additional tissue specific factors are needed to mediate the LXRs/ABCA1 effect on A secretion. The experiments with Tangier fibroblasts, which lack a functional ABCA1 protein, clearly demonstrated that ABCA1 affects APP processing. The fact that A secretion was lower in control fibroblasts than in Tangier cells demonstrates that the decrease in A is related to an intrinsic cellular activity of ABCA1. Furthermore, the effect of LXR/RXR ligands required a functional ABCA1 (absent in both Tangier cell lines) to affect A secretion. We were surprised, however, to find that T0901317 increased A secretion in TT1 cell line, which expresses a full-length but non-functional ABCA1 protein. It is possible that increased expression of a non-functional ABCA1 has a dominant negative effect on another cellular component that limits the secretion of A. If so, ABCA1 may function as part of a multicomponent complex that inhibits the secretion of A. The amino acid substitution in TT1 (asparagine to serine) affects the conserved Walker A motif of the N-terminal ATP binding fold. This domain may affect ATP binding and hydrolysis but may also be critical for functional interactions of ABCA1 with intracellular effector molecules and components involved in trafficking and secretion. For example, Rac1, which is a key regulator in the secretion of the non-amyloidogenic sAPP (37), was shown to accumulate in primary fibroblasts of the T1 pedigree (38). It is conceivable that a mutant ABCA1 may affect such protein and that a point mutation may result in a more severe phenotype than complete ABCA1 deficiency. In this context, it is interesting to note that one of the two homozygous Tangier disease patients of the T1 pedigree developed signs of severe dementia and amyloid depositions at age 60.2 However, none of the three homozygous Tangier patients of the T2 family have signs of dementia. By contrast, the asparagine to serine mutation of T1 is apparently not associated with premature atherosclerosis (39), whereas all three homozygous patients of the T2 pedigree suffer from severe premature atherosclerosis (30). Altogether these biochemical and clinical data suggest (a) that ABCA1 acts in concert with an unknown component in secretion of A, (b) that the genotype of the ABCA1 mutations may determine the clinical phenotype observed in these patients, and (c) that the influence of ABCA1 on AD and athrogenesis is mediated by at least partly different mechanisms. Because the ratio of secreted sAPP over sAPP was increased in the brain of T0901317-treated mice and A140 and A142 was decreased, our results suggest that the synthetic LXR ligand increases the non-amyloidogenic processing of APP. Previously, we and others found (22, 24) a significant decrease in a steady state level of CTF/ after in vitro treatment with LXR/RXR"

T0901317 (T0) (50 mg/kg/day) was applied for 6 days to 11-week-old APP23 mice. A, the expression of ABCA1 after T0901317 treatment was examined by Western blotting. Quantification of ABCA1 protein level, normalized to the level of -tubulin expression is presented below. B, the levels of sAPP and sAPP were determined by Western blotting, and bands quantified and presented as the ratio of sAPP/sAPP. C, Western blotting of CTF and CTF.

To examine the effect of T0901317 on APP processing, we determined the amount of sAPP and sAPP by Western blotting. sAPP and sAPP were determined in diethylamine extracts, because this technique separates soluble A and sAPP from membrane-associated full-length APP and CTF resulting from - and -secretase cleavages (CTF and CTF). Fig. 6B (graph panel) shows that the ratio of sAPP- to -secretase cleavage product was significantly decreased after T0901317 treatment. This was in agreement with our previous in vitro data demonstrating that LXR ligands increase -secretase cleavage and sAPP secretion (22). T0901317 did not induce a significant change in the level of CTFs (Fig. 6C), which was in contrast with the in vitro effect of LXR/RXR ligands (22). Because LXR/RXR ligands are known to regulate the expression of apoE, we also examined the level of apoE protein in brain homogenates after T0901317 treatment. As visible from Fig. 6D the ligand treatment did not cause significant change in the apoE protein level. Finally we examined the effect of T0901317 on A production. Because at this age A in the brain of APP23 mice is soluble in SDS, A was extracted from the initial brain homogenate by SDS containing RIPA buffer or diethylamine, and the results from the two determinations compared. Fig. 7, A and B show the levels of RIPA-extracted A40 and A42 in APP23 mice were significantly decreased. Similar results were obtained by ELISA determinations of diethylamine-extracted soluble A40 and A42 (not shown), thus confirming that amyloidogenic processing of human APP in APP23 mice was decreased after T0901317 treatment.

DISCUSSION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION MATERIALS AND METHODS RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES  Epidemiological data suggest that vascular risk factors such as high blood pressure and high total plasma cholesterol (1, 2) increase the risk not only for vascular dementia but also for late onset Alzheimer's disease (4, 7). In addition, low HDL cholesterol and serum apoA-I concentrations are highly correlated with the severity of AD (5, 9, 10). In mice overexpressing human APPsw, diet-induced hypercholesterolemia correlated with brain A deposits (34). The amyloid burden correlated inversely with plasma levels of HDL (35). ABCA1 is a major regulator of cholesterol efflux and HDL metabolism, and its transcriptional activation is controlled by nuclear liver X receptors and . A detailed examination of LXR double knockout mice has shown that LXRs have an important function not only in lipid homeostasis in the brain, but that the loss of these receptors results in neurodegenerative disease (36). Recently, we and others showed (2224) that ligands for LXR/ increased ABCA1 expression in neuronal cells and reduced A secretion. In the present study, we examined the effect of the synthetic LXR ligand T0901317 in vitro and in vivo in a mouse model for AD. To examine the effect of T0901317 on APP processing in vitro, we used non-neuronal and neuronal cell lines and primary neuronal culture. In all these models T0901317 increased ABCA1 expression and decreased A secretion, confirming our previous results with hydroxysterols. Furthermore, apoA-I led to an additional decrease in secreted A, suggesting that lipid efflux and related decrease in intracellular cholesterol concentration are important factors in APP processing. Several important observations should be noted, however. Although the increase in ABCA1 expression caused by LXR/RXR was comparable in primary neurons and non-neuronal cells, there were cell-type-specific differences in the magnitude of T0901317-induced effect on A secretion. Ligand-mediated suppression of A secretion was robust in primary neurons and neuronal cell lines but much less pronounced in fibroblasts suggesting that additional tissue specific factors are needed to mediate the LXRs/ABCA1 effect on A secretion. The experiments with Tangier fibroblasts, which lack a functional ABCA1 protein, clearly demonstrated that ABCA1 affects APP processing. The fact that A secretion was lower in control fibroblasts than in Tangier cells demonstrates that the decrease in A is related to an intrinsic cellular activity of ABCA1. Furthermore, the effect of LXR/RXR ligands required a functional ABCA1 (absent in both Tangier cell lines) to affect A secretion. We were surprised, however, to find that T0901317 increased A secretion in TT1 cell line, which expresses a full-length but non-functional ABCA1 protein. It is possible that increased expression of a non-functional ABCA1 has a dominant negative effect on another cellular component that limits the secretion of A. If so, ABCA1 may function as part of a multicomponent complex that inhibits the secretion of A. The amino acid substitution in TT1 (asparagine to serine) affects the conserved Walker A motif of the N-terminal ATP binding fold. This domain may affect ATP binding and hydrolysis but may also be critical for functional interactions of ABCA1 with intracellular effector molecules and components involved in trafficking and secretion. For example, Rac1, which is a key regulator in the secretion of the non-amyloidogenic sAPP (37), was shown to accumulate in primary fibroblasts of the T1 pedigree (38). It is conceivable that a mutant ABCA1 may affect such protein and that a point mutation may result in a more severe phenotype than complete ABCA1 deficiency. In this context, it is interesting to note that one of the two homozygous Tangier disease patients of the T1 pedigree developed signs of severe dementia and amyloid depositions at age 60.2 However, none of the three homozygous Tangier patients of the T2 family have signs of dementia. By contrast, the asparagine to serine mutation of T1 is apparently not associated with premature atherosclerosis (39), whereas all three homozygous patients of the T2 pedigree suffer from severe premature atherosclerosis (30). Altogether these biochemical and clinical data suggest (a) that ABCA1 acts in concert with an unknown component in secretion of A, (b) that the genotype of the ABCA1 mutations may determine the clinical phenotype observed in these patients, and (c) that the influence of ABCA1 on AD and athrogenesis is mediated by at least partly different mechanisms. Because the ratio of secreted sAPP over sAPP was increased in the brain of T0901317-treated mice and A140 and A142 was decreased, our results suggest that the synthetic LXR ligand increases the non-amyloidogenic processing of APP. Previously, we and others found (22, 24) a significant decrease in a steady state level of CTF/ after in vitro treatment with LXR/RXR that was not confirmed after in vivo treatment. The reason for this discrepancy is not clear, but similar results have been described before (40). The complexity of the changes induced by T0901317 treatment may also result in an alteration of the complete degradation of CTFs in the treated animals.

Phrase: "and toxicity (51). Therefore, the absence of HDL and apoA-I may complicate the clearance of A from the brain. Recently two independent groups demonstrated that ABCA1/ mice have dramatic decrease in apoE levels in the whole brain and cerebrospinal fluid (52, 53). ApoE is a major brain apolipoprotein and the ApoE4 genotype is a risk factor for AD and cerebral amyloid angiopathy. ApoE is considered an A chaperone that influences A clearance and fibrillogenesis. The role of apoE as a pathological chaperone is demonstrated in apoE/ mice that accumulate much less fibrillar amyloid than wild type apoE mice (54, 55). However, because in ABCA1/ mice the two major brain apolipoproteins apoE and apoA-I are virtually missing, it is difficult to predict how the lack of ABCA1 will affect the AD phenotype. The critical role of LXR and ABCA1 in central nervous system and APP metabolism is reinforced by the data presented here, thus suggesting that ABCA1 may be a novel therapeutic target for AD. Cellular and in vivo studies should provide a critical proof of concept for the regulation of APP processing by LXR through the transcriptional control of ABCA1, apoE, and possibly other genes in support of the search for potent and specific LXR ligands with properties allowing therapeutic application.

The neurons, plated at high density (5 x 105/ml) in 12-well plates were infected at day in vitro 4 with herpes simplex replication-deficient vectors (HSVAPPsw). The expression of human APPsw was determined by Western blotting using the 6E10 antibody, which recognizes only human APP (Fig. 3A). On the next day the infected neurons were treated for 24 h with 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol and apoA-I, and Ab40 secretion was determined by ELISA. 22(R)-Hydroxycholesterol when combined with apoA-I decreased A40 secretion more than 5 times (Fig. 3B). T0901317 applied alone had a slightly smaller effect on A40 secretion (Fig. 3C) even without the addition of apoA-I.

A, primary neuronal cultures were made from dissociated cortices and hippocampi of 1718-day-old mouse embryos, and the neurons at day in vitro 4 were infected with HSV control virus (A, lane 1) or with HSVAPPsw (A, lanes 2 and 3) at multiplicity of infection 5.

Infected neurons were treated with 10 and 20 M T0901317 (T0) without apoA-I, and A40 and A42 secretion was determined by ELISA.

ABCA1 Overexpression in Transfection Experiments Decreases A SecretionTo determine whether the induction of ABCA1 might be responsible for a decreased secretion of A, we transiently transfected CHOAPPsw cells with ABCA1 and incubated cells with or without apoA-I. The transfection of ABCA1 resulted in expression levels of ABCA1 protein comparable with those induced by LXR/RXR activators (Fig. 4A, top panel) without affecting cellular APP levels (middle panel). Fig. 4B shows that overexpression of ABCA1 caused a statistically significant decrease in A40 levels, and the addition of apoA-I simultaneously to ABCA1 transfection caused a more than 2-fold decrease as compared with the mock-transfected cells. The overexpression of ABCA1 alone did not cause a statistically significant decrease in secretion of A42, although the addition of apoA-I resulted in a more than 4-fold decrease in A42 secretion. Therefore, the overexpression of ABCA1 decreased A secretion in a similar fashion as treatment with LXR/RXR ligands suggesting that the effect of the ligands could be mediated through ABCA1.

A, Western blot for ABCA1, full-length APP, and -tubulin (B-tub) proteins in CHOAPPsw cells transiently transfected with empty vector (Lane 1, control) or recombinant vector for ABCA1 overexpression (lane 2). B and C, CHOAPPsw cells were transiently transfected as in A, and A40 and A42 levels in medium were measured by ELISA. A secretion was determined with (ABC + apo) or without the addition of apoA-I (ABC only). Data (mean  S.E.) are from two experiments in triplicate. *, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01 compared with mock control. A is normalized to total protein (TP).  Mutations in ABCA1 Increase A SecretionNext we examined whether a functional ABCA1 protein was required for the effect of LXR/RXR ligands on A secretion. For these experiments we used permanent cell lines derived from Tangier patients. The TT1, TT2, and CT cell lines are telomerase immortalized skin fibroblasts from two Tangier patients and a control subject (30). TT1 was derived from T1 patient homozygous for an asparagine to serine amino acid substitution in exon 19 (AAT/AGT, amino acid position 935 of the primary translation product) resulting in the expression of full-length, albeit non-functional, protein (Fig. 5B, middle panel). The TT2 cell line was established from the T2 patient characterized by a homozygous 1-bp deletion in exon 1. This deletion introduces a stop codon at position 575, resulting in the omission of the majority of the ABCA1 protein sequence and expression of a truncated protein (Fig. 5B, bottom panel). First, we examined the basal level of A in medium from Tangier and control fibroblasts conditioned for 48 h without treatment. Fig. 5A demonstrates that the Tangier cell lines (TT1 and TT2) produced significantly more A40 as compared with normal fibroblasts (CT). In addition there was a statistically significant difference between Tangier cells, with TT2 secreting more A40 than TT1 cell line. Because the expression of endogenous APP in fibroblasts was very low we were not able to determine the secretion of A42. View larger version (26K): [in this window] [in a new window]  FIG. 5. T0901317 decreases A secretion in control but not in Tangier fibroblasts. A, the basal level of A40 in control (CT) and Tangier fibroblasts (TT1 and TT2) was determined by ELISA after a 48-h incubation in medium without ligands. **, p < 0.008 versus CT cells. Data (mean  S.E.) are the results from two experiments in triplicate. B, ABCA1 expression in CT, TT1, and TT2 cells. Cells were treated with vehicle (Veh) or 15 M T0901317 + 15 M retinoic acid (T0+RA), and the expression of ABCA1 was determined by Western blotting. The graph below represents the -fold increase in ABCA1 protein expression in CT and TT1 cells treated with vehicle () or ligands (). C and D, the Tangier and control fibroblasts were infected with HSVAPPsw as in Fig. 3, treated with 15 M T0901317 + 15 M retinoic acid () or vehicle () for 24 h, and A40 (C) and Ab42 (D) were determined by ELISA. For BD the results are the mean  S.E. from three experiments in triplicate. *, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01; ***, p < 0.001 versus vehicle-treated control.  To examine the effect of T0901317 on A40 and A42 secretion, Tangier fibroblasts were infected with HSVAPPsw and were treated with T0901317 and retinoic acid without apoA-I. This treatment increased the expression of ABCA1 protein in CT and TT1 cells by 4- and 6-fold, respectively (Fig. 5B, top and middle panels). As expected there was not detectable ABCA1 protein in TT2 (Fig. 5B, bottom panel). The secretion of A40 and A42 was decreased only in the control fibroblasts and was not changed in TT2 cells (Fig. 5, C and D). The decrease in control fibroblasts was modest but statistically significant. Surprisingly, ligand treatment in TT1 cells induced a statistically significant increase in the secretion of amyloid beta (A40 and A42). The effect of T0901317 on control and Tangier cells was confirmed for A40 in non-infected cells expressing the endogenous APPwt (data not shown). Therefore, the existence of full-length functional ABCA1 is required to mediate the inhibitory effect of LXR/RXR ligands on A secretion. In Vivo LXR Ligand Treatment Increases Brain ABCA1 Expression and Influences Amyloidogenic Processing of Human APP in APP23 MiceTo examine the role of T0901317 on ABCA1 expression in vivo, we treated 11-week-old APP23 mice orally by gastric gavage for 6 days with 50 mg/kg/day T0901317. Control mice received vehicle only. The treatment of APP23 mice resulted in a substantial increase in the expression of ABCA1 (more than 3-fold, p < 0.001), whereas the expression of APP was unchanged (Fig. 6, A and B).

To examine the effect of T0901317 on APP processing, we determined the amount of sAPP and sAPP by Western blotting. sAPP and sAPP were determined in diethylamine extracts, because this technique separates soluble A and sAPP from membrane-associated full-length APP and CTF resulting from - and -secretase cleavages (CTF and CTF). Fig. 6B (graph panel) shows that the ratio of sAPP- to -secretase cleavage product was significantly decreased after T0901317 treatment. This was in agreement with our previous in vitro data demonstrating that LXR ligands increase -secretase cleavage and sAPP secretion (22). T0901317 did not induce a significant change in the level of CTFs (Fig. 6C), which was in contrast with the in vitro effect of LXR/RXR ligands (22). Because LXR/RXR ligands are known to regulate the expression of apoE, we also examined the level of apoE protein in brain homogenates after T0901317 treatment. As visible from Fig. 6D the ligand treatment did not cause significant change in the apoE protein level. Finally we examined the effect of T0901317 on A production. Because at this age A in the brain of APP23 mice is soluble in SDS, A was extracted from the initial brain homogenate by SDS containing RIPA buffer or diethylamine, and the results from the two determinations compared. Fig. 7, A and B show the levels of RIPA-extracted A40 and A42 in APP23 mice were significantly decreased. Similar results were obtained by ELISA determinations of diethylamine-extracted soluble A40 and A42 (not shown), thus confirming that amyloidogenic processing of human APP in APP23 mice was decreased after T0901317 treatment.

DISCUSSION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION MATERIALS AND METHODS RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES  Epidemiological data suggest that vascular risk factors such as high blood pressure and high total plasma cholesterol (1, 2) increase the risk not only for vascular dementia but also for late onset Alzheimer's disease (4, 7). In addition, low HDL cholesterol and serum apoA-I concentrations are highly correlated with the severity of AD (5, 9, 10). In mice overexpressing human APPsw, diet-induced hypercholesterolemia correlated with brain A deposits (34). The amyloid burden correlated inversely with plasma levels of HDL (35). ABCA1 is a major regulator of cholesterol efflux and HDL metabolism, and its transcriptional activation is controlled by nuclear liver X receptors and . A detailed examination of LXR double knockout mice has shown that LXRs have an important function not only in lipid homeostasis in the brain, but that the loss of these receptors results in neurodegenerative disease (36). Recently, we and others showed (2224) that ligands for LXR/ increased ABCA1 expression in neuronal cells and reduced A secretion. In the present study, we examined the effect of the synthetic LXR ligand T0901317 in vitro and in vivo in a mouse model for AD. To examine the effect of T0901317 on APP processing in vitro, we used non-neuronal and neuronal cell lines and primary neuronal culture. In all these models T0901317 increased ABCA1 expression and decreased A secretion, confirming our previous results with hydroxysterols. Furthermore, apoA-I led to an additional decrease in secreted A, suggesting that lipid efflux and related decrease in intracellular cholesterol concentration are important factors in APP processing. Several important observations should be noted, however. Although the increase in ABCA1 expression caused by LXR/RXR was comparable in primary neurons and non-neuronal cells, there were cell-type-specific differences in the magnitude of T0901317-induced effect on A secretion. Ligand-mediated suppression of A secretion was robust in primary neurons and neuronal cell lines but much less pronounced in fibroblasts suggesting that additional tissue specific factors are needed to mediate the LXRs/ABCA1 effect on A secretion. The experiments with Tangier fibroblasts, which lack a functional ABCA1 protein, clearly demonstrated that ABCA1 affects APP processing. The fact that A secretion was lower in control fibroblasts than in Tangier cells demonstrates that the decrease in A is related to an intrinsic cellular activity of ABCA1. Furthermore, the effect of LXR/RXR ligands required a functional ABCA1 (absent in both Tangier cell lines) to affect A secretion. We were surprised, however, to find that T0901317 increased A secretion in TT1 cell line, which expresses a full-length but non-functional ABCA1 protein. It is possible that increased expression of a non-functional ABCA1 has a dominant negative effect on another cellular component that limits the secretion of A. If so, ABCA1 may function as part of a multicomponent complex that inhibits the secretion of A. The amino acid substitution in TT1 (asparagine to serine) affects the conserved Walker A motif of the N-terminal ATP binding fold. This domain may affect ATP binding and hydrolysis but may also be critical for functional interactions of ABCA1 with intracellular effector molecules and components involved in trafficking and secretion. For example, Rac1, which is a key regulator in the secretion of the non-amyloidogenic sAPP (37), was shown to accumulate in primary fibroblasts of the T1 pedigree (38). It is conceivable that a mutant ABCA1 may affect such protein and that a point mutation may result in a more severe phenotype than complete ABCA1 deficiency. In this context, it is interesting to note that one of the two homozygous Tangier disease patients of the T1 pedigree developed signs of severe dementia and amyloid depositions at age 60.2 However, none of the three homozygous Tangier patients of the T2 family have signs of dementia. By contrast, the asparagine to serine mutation of T1 is apparently not associated with premature atherosclerosis (39), whereas all three homozygous patients of the T2 pedigree suffer from severe premature atherosclerosis (30). Altogether these biochemical and clinical data suggest (a) that ABCA1 acts in concert with an unknown component in secretion of A, (b) that the genotype of the ABCA1 mutations may determine the clinical phenotype observed in these patients, and (c) that the influence of ABCA1 on AD and athrogenesis is mediated by at least partly different mechanisms. Because the ratio of secreted sAPP over sAPP was increased in the brain of T0901317-treated mice and A140 and A142 was decreased, our results suggest that the synthetic LXR ligand increases the non-amyloidogenic processing of APP. Previously, we and others found (22, 24) a significant decrease in a steady state level of CTF/ after in vitro treatment with LXR/RXR that was not confirmed after in vivo treatment. The reason for this discrepancy is not clear, but similar results have been described before (40). The complexity of the changes induced by T0901317 treatment may also result in an alteration of the complete degradation of CTFs in the treated animals. Previous studies have shown that LXR/RXR ligands increased the expression of apoE in macrophages and adipocytes (41, 42). However the role of LXR on apoE expression in the brain is controversial. Whitney et al. (43) failed to observe an effect of T0901317 on apoE expression in the brain, whereas another group has shown a dramatic increase in the expression of apoE after T0901317 treatment in human astrocytoma cells but a modest effect on mouse apoE expression in vitro and in vivo (42). In the present study we also did not find a significant change in apoE protein expression after T0901317 treatment in vivo, in agreement with Whitney et al. (43). The reasons for the discrepancy between human and mouse brain cells are unknown, but it is possible that different regulatory elements of apoE expression existing in humans are absent in mice. A normally is present in cerebrospinal fluid and in plasma, associated with apolipoproteins and lipoproteins (4449), and its clearance from the brain is mediated by low density lipoprotein receptors (50). A lack of ABCA1 in humans and mice causes abnormal lipidation and increased catabolism of HDL, resulting in virtual absence of plasma apoA-I and HDL. Experiments with neuronal cell lines have shown that apoA-I binds A and decreases its aggregation and toxicity (51). Therefore, the absence of HDL and apoA-I may complicate the clearance of A from the brain. Recently two independent groups demonstrated that ABCA1/ mice have dramatic decrease in apoE levels in the whole brain and cerebrospinal fluid (52, 53). ApoE is a major brain apolipoprotein and the ApoE4 genotype is a risk factor for AD and cerebral amyloid angiopathy. ApoE is considered an A chaperone that influences A clearance and fibrillogenesis. The role of apoE as a pathological chaperone is demonstrated in apoE/ mice that accumulate much less fibrillar amyloid than wild type apoE mice (54, 55). However, because in ABCA1/ mice the two major brain apolipoproteins apoE and apoA-I are virtually missing, it is difficult to predict how the lack of ABCA1 will affect the AD phenotype. The critical role of LXR and ABCA1 in central nervous system and APP metabolism is reinforced by the data presented here, thus suggesting that ABCA1 may be a novel therapeutic target for AD. Cellular and in vivo studies should provide a critical proof of concept for the regulation of APP processing by LXR through the transcriptional control of ABCA1, apoE, and possibly other genes in support of the search for potent and specific LXR ligands with properties allowing therapeutic application.

For example, Rac1, which is a key regulator in the secretion of the non-amyloidogenic sAPP (37), was shown to accumulate in primary fibroblasts of the T1 pedigree (38). It is conceivable that a mutant ABCA1 may affect such protein and that a point mutation may result in a more severe phenotype than complete ABCA1 deficiency. In this context, it is interesting to note that one of the two homozygous Tangier disease patients of the T1 pedigree developed signs of severe dementia and amyloid depositions at age 60.2 However, none of the three homozygous Tangier patients of the T2 family have signs of dementia. By contrast, the asparagine to serine mutation of T1 is apparently not associated with premature atherosclerosis (39), whereas all three homozygous patients of the T2 pedigree suffer from severe premature atherosclerosis (30). Altogether these biochemical and clinical data suggest (a) that ABCA1 acts in concert with an unknown component in secretion of A, (b) that the genotype of the ABCA1 mutations may determine the clinical phenotype observed in these patients, and (c) that the influence of ABCA1 on AD and athrogenesis is mediated by at least partly different mechanisms. Because the ratio of secreted sAPP over sAPP was increased in the brain of T0901317-treated mice and A140 and A142 was decreased, our results suggest that the synthetic LXR ligand increases the non-amyloidogenic processing of APP. Previously, we and others found (22, 24) a significant decrease in a steady state level of CTF/ after in vitro treatment with LXR/RXR that was not confirmed after in vivo treatment. The reason for this discrepancy is not clear, but similar results have been described before (40). The complexity of the changes induced by T0901317 treatment may also result in an alteration of the complete degradation of CTFs in the treated animals. Previous studies have shown that LXR/RXR ligands increased the expression of apoE in macrophages and adipocytes (41, 42). However the role of LXR on apoE expression in the brain is controversial. Whitney et al. (43) failed to observe an effect of T0901317 on apoE expression in the brain, whereas another group has shown a dramatic increase in the expression of apoE after T0901317 treatment in human astrocytoma cells but a modest effect on mouse apoE expression in vitro and in vivo (42). In the present study we also did not find a significant change in apoE protein expression after T0901317 treatment in vivo, in agreement with Whitney et al. (43). The reasons for the discrepancy between human and mouse brain cells are unknown, but it is possible that different regulatory elements of apoE expression existing in humans are absent in mice. A normally is present in cerebrospinal fluid and in plasma, associated with apolipoproteins and lipoproteins (4449), and its clearance from the brain is mediated by low density lipoprotein receptors (50). A lack of ABCA1 in humans and mice causes abnormal lipidation and increased catabolism of HDL, resulting in virtual absence of plasma apoA-I and HDL. Experiments with neuronal cell lines have shown that apoA-I binds A and decreases its aggregation and toxicity (51). Therefore, the absence of HDL and apoA-I may complicate the clearance of A from the brain. Recently two independent groups demonstrated that ABCA1/ mice have dramatic decrease in apoE levels in the whole brain and cerebrospinal fluid (52, 53). ApoE is a major brain apolipoprotein and the ApoE4 genotype is a risk factor for AD and cerebral amyloid angiopathy. ApoE is considered an A chaperone that influences A clearance and fibrillogenesis. The role of apoE as a pathological chaperone is demonstrated in apoE/ mice that accumulate much less fibrillar amyloid than wild type apoE mice (54, 55). However, because in ABCA1/ mice the two major brain apolipoproteins apoE and apoA-I are virtually missing, it is difficult to predict how the lack of ABCA1 will affect the AD phenotype. The critical role of LXR and ABCA1 in central nervous system and APP metabolism is reinforced by the data presented here, thus suggesting that ABCA1 may be a novel therapeutic target for AD. Cellular and in vivo studies should provide a critical proof of concept for the regulation of APP processing by LXR through the transcriptional control of ABCA1, apoE, and possibly other genes in support of the search for potent and specific LXR ligands with properties allowing therapeutic application.
