Phrase: "IL-23/IL-23R systems in AD, we examined the influence of IL-121 (IL12RB1) gene polymorphisms in AD susceptibility in the Japanese population.  RESULTS TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION RESULTS DISCUSSION MATERIALS AND METHODS SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL REFERENCES  Identification of sequence variants in IL12RB1 Direct DNA sequencing revealed 48 IL12RB1 variants, which included previously reported variants (2124) and 10 novel variants (3966C/A, 2163C/T, 1973C/T, 355G/A, 3377C/A, 5854G/A, 9354G/T, 10129G/A, 18205C/T and 20228G/A) in Japanese (Table 1). We identified nine variants in the 5'-flanking region, nine in the coding region (seven non-synonymous and two synonymous), one in the 5'-untranslated region (UTR), one in the 3'-UTR, 21 within introns and seven at the 3' end. Twelve of the 48 variants had estimated minor allele frequencies (MAFs) of <10% (on the basis of the sequencing of 24 DNA samples). Nucleotide position one (+1) was defined as the first adenine of the initiation codon (ATG) and positions for other SNPs were described relative to the ATG on genome contig AC020904. A graphical overview of the structure of the human IL12RB1 gene with the location of the 36 common polymorphisms (MAF10%) identified in this study is shown in Figure 1A. View this table: [in this window] [in a new window]  Table1. Overview of IL12RB1 variants identified in Japanese  View larger version (41K): [in this window] [in a new window]  Figure1. (A) A graphical overview of the 36 identified SNPs in relation to the exon/intron structure of the human IL12RB1 gene. Nucleotide position one (+1) is the first adenine of the initiation codon (ATG) such that SNP positions are given relative to the ATG. The 17 coding exons are shown by black boxes and the 5'- and 3'-UTRs by white blocks. Asterisks indicate SNPs that were genotyped in a larger population. (B) Pair-wise LD, as measured by D' and r2, was calculated for 35 common polymorphisms (MAF10%) identified in 24 sequenced samples. Two measures of LD are shown: D' in the lower left triangle and r2 in the upper right triangle. The markers are plotted equidistantly. Scales for both LD measures are provided below. Asterisks indicate SNPs that were genotyped in a larger population.  LD and casecontrol comparisons For the successfully genotyped 35 of 36 common variants, we calculated both D' and r2 as statistical values for pair-wise linkage disequilibrium (LD) analysis between SNPs. The LD block structure defined by the 35 genotyped SNPs is shown in Figure 1B. Strong LD was detected across the IL12RB1 region, although at least two historical recombination events seem to have occurred, which divided the region into three strongly correlated LD blocks. Next, on the basis of location and LD with other sites (r2<0.9), we selected eight representative SNPs (111A/T, 2C/T, 4443C/T, 5970G/C, 17183T/C, 17369C/T, 25748T/C and 27637A/T) from the 36 common polymorphisms for further genotyping and association studies in our AD population. The distribution of all eight SNPs was in HardyWeinberg equilibrium in both AD and control groups (P>0.05). For the casecontrol association study, we genotyped the eight selected SNPs in a set of 382 unrelated individuals with AD and 658 population-based controls. The clinical characteristics of our AD patients are summarized in Table 2. Allele and genotype frequencies of each selected SNP were compared between the patients and the normal controls using the 2 test under different association models. We found a significant association between two promoter SNPs at 111 and 2 (111A/T and 2C/T) and AD in our Japanese cohort under a recessive model (111AA+AT versus TT, P=0.00044; 2CC+CT versus TT, P=0.00075; Table 3). The result for each SNP remained significant after correction for multiple tests (corrected P: Pc=0.0035 for 111A/T and Pc=0.006 for 2C/T). Homozygotes for the 111T or 2T alleles were significantly more common in AD patients when compared with controls. Odds ratios (ORs) of developing AD with respect to positions 111 and 2 were 2.46 (95%CI 1.474.13) and 2.60 (95%CI 1.464.61), respectively. Genotype frequencies in Japanese AD cases and controls for 111 and 2 SNPs were shown in Table 4. View this table: [in this window] [in a new window]  Table2. Clinical characteristics of patients with AD  View this table: [in this window] [in a new window]  Table3. Association of eight selected polymorphisms in IL12RB1 with AD  View this table: [in this window] [in a new window]  Table4. Genotype frequencies in Japanese AD cases and controls for IL12RB1 SNPs at nucleotide positions 111 and 2  In further analyses of patient subgroups, we observed strong associations between the presence of high total serum IgE, early age of disease onset (3) and peripheral blood eosinophilia (>500/l), as well as history of childhood asthma and allergic rhinitis (Table 5). No significant differences were observed for the other clinical features tested (data not shown). Notably, the 111T/T genotype was progressively more common in AD with high total serum IgE levels in an IgE-level-dependent manner. Interestingly, when we analyzed the 111A/T SNP in the independent population of physician-diagnosed asthma, the 111T/T genotype frequency in 304 child asthmatics aged 415years (9.2%) tended to be much higher than that in the control group (4.2%). Then, to further confirm the influence of the 111 genotype on IgE regulation, we compared total serum IgE levels in AD patients according to genotype. Although the results for AD patients were not statistically significant, we observed the same trend of increasing total serum IgE levels with increasing occurrence of the 111T allele (Fig.2).

Relationship of IL12RB1 111 promoter genotype with total serum IgE levels in AD patients. Log-transformed individual IgE values are plotted, with the mean (x) and SD (bar) shown for each genotype group.  Haplotype analysis Among eight representative SNPs, SNPs located out of the first LD block were not in strong LD with the 111 and 2 SNPs (r20.6). We analyzed the distribution of two-locus haplotype in AD, childhood asthma and control samples. Of the two promoter IL12RB1 haplotypes that constituted the 111A/T and 2C/T SNPs, the 111A/2C haplotype was the most common, followed by 111T/2T and 111T/2C. Association studies for each haplotype with AD identified a borderline-significant association of both the 111A/2C and 111T/2T haplotypes with AD (Table 6). For child asthmatics, results of the haplotype analysis showed a significant association (global P=0.005). These associations were not stronger than those observed for the single loci. However, these results cannot exclude the possibility that any other variants lying on the 111T/2T haplotype may be involved in AD and asthma. We also analyzed the global distribution of IL12RB1 haplotypes comprising the eight SNPs between the patient and control groups. Ten haplotypes, each of which consisted of eight SNPs that had a calculated frequency >1%, were observed in the control group (data not shown). These 10 haplotypes accounted for more than 95% of all haplotypes estimated in the study population. View this table: [in this window] [in a new window]  Table6.

In this study, to confirm the expression of IL12RB1 mRNA transcripts in target cells, we carried out RTPCR analysis of multiple tissue cDNA panels. We observed IL12RB1 expression in various tissues including spleen and lymph nodes, as well as in activated mononuclear and CD4+ cells (Fig.3). Furthermore, as shown previously (27), we also detected transcripts in lymphohematopoietic cell lines (Jurkat, Daudi, MOLT3, MOLT4, THP-1 and U937), but not in HL60, Hela and HEK293 cell lines (data not shown).

PCR amplification between IL12RB1 exons 10 and 13 is shown in the upper panel. The GAPDH control is shown in the lower panel.  Identification of the regulatory elements in the IL12RB1 promoter, transcriptional effect of 111A/T SNP and association of the 111 genotype with IL12RB1 mRNA expression We constructed a deletion panel of the IL12RB1 upstream region encompassing nucleotides 2947 to 65 (Fig.4A). Transcriptional activity of the promoter constructs derived from the wild-type allele (2252G/2060A/2004A/111A/2C) was analyzed in transiently transfected Jurkat, HEK293 and THP-1 cells by measuring firefly luciferase activity. The relative changes in transcriptional activity among the IL12RB1 promoter constructs were generally similar between the cell lines (data not shown). Deletion of 5' sequence between 762 and 265 significantly increased activity (1.6-fold in Jurkat cells, P<0.01), which suggested the presence of a silencer in the 762/265 region. Of the promoter constructs tested, the 265/65 fragment showed the highest activity. Further, 5' deletion of this fragment to 104/65 caused a dramatic reduction of promoter activity to 23% of the 265/65 fragment (P<0.001), which suggested that the 265/104 region contained an enhancer element.

Identification of regulatory elements in the IL12RB1 promoter, transcriptional effect of the 111A/T SNP and association of the 111 genotype with IL12RB1 mRNA expression. (A) The indicated IL12RB1 gene promoter fragments derived from wild-type allele sequence (2252G/2060A/2004A/111A/2C) were cloned into the pGL3-basic vector and transiently cotransfected with pRL-TK vector as internal control. *P<0.01; **P<0.001. (B) Relative luciferase activities of constructs containing the human IL12RB1 gene fragments (from 265 to 65bp), with 111A or 111T, were compared in transient transfection assays using Jurkat cells. The relative luciferase activity of the IL12RB1 reporter constructs is represented as the ratio of firefly luciferase activity to that of Renilla. Data are expressed as meanSD of three independent experiments performed in triplicate. *P<0.01. (C) Quantitative IL12RB1 mRNA expression in stimulated PBMCs from healthy volunteers (A/A, n=8; A/T, n=6; T/T, n=1). IL12RB1 mRNA levels in cells from IL12RB1111A/A, IL12RB1111A/T and IL12RB1111T/T individuals following anti-CD3 stimulation are shown. Relative mRNA levels were defined as the net intensity of IL12RB1 and GAPDH (IL12RB1/GAPDH). *P (A/A versus A/T+ T/T)=0.019.  To determine the effect of the A/T polymorphism at position 111 on promoter activity, we transiently expressed 111A and 111T luciferase reporter constructs (pGL3/111A and pGL3/111T, respectively) in Jurkat cells. Luciferase activity in cell extracts was analyzed 24h after transfection and was standardized against internal control Renilla activity. Results indicated that the 111T construct that consisted of the 265/65 fragment showed a significant decrease in luciferase reporter activity when compared with the 111A construct (33%, P<0.01; Fig.4B). Similarly, the 111T construct had only 4070% of the 111A luciferase activity in THP-1 cells and HEK293 cell lines (data not shown), which suggested that the 111A/T substitution impaired a functional promoter element. Thus, it appeared that the 111T allele was associated with decreased transcriptional activity of the IL12RB1 gene. We also tested whether the C/T SNP at 2 affected IL12RB1 promoter activity, using the 64/+64 fragment. Results indicated that the 64/+64 region that contained the 2C/T SNP had only slight activity in Jurkat cells (Fig.4A). Moreover, no significant differences in expression levels were detected between 2C and 2T promoter constructs in transiently transfected Jurkat cells (data not shown). During this study, we had identified three SNPs in the IL12RB1 promoter, which also showed a high degree of LD (2252G/T, 2060A/G and 2004A/G). Deletion of 5' sequence between 2947 and 1668 that contained these SNPs caused no obvious change in transcriptional activity. We also observed almost identical relative luciferase activity between 2252G/2060A/2004A and 2252T/2060G/2004G promoter constructs (data not shown). Quantitative real-time PCR was performed to assess IL12RB1 mRNA expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from healthy subjects with different 111 IL12RB1 promoter genotypes (haplotypes). Relative values for IL12RB1 mRNA expression were obtained by dividing the IL12RB1 mRNA abundance by the GAPDH mRNA abundance. Results indicated that the IL12RB1 mRNA expression was significantly higher in anti-CD3-stimulated cells carrying the 111A/A genotype (111A/2C homozygotes) when compared with those carrying the 111T allele (111A/T or 111T/T genotypes) (111AA versus AT+TT, P=0.019; 111AA versus AT, P=0.021; Fig.4C). There was a similar tendency observed for unstimulated and PHA-stimulated cells, which was borderline significant (P=0.040.06).  DISCUSSION TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION RESULTS DISCUSSION MATERIALS AND METHODS SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL REFERENCES  In this study, we identified 48 IL12RB1 gene variants, including 10 novel variants, in a Japanese population. We selected eight representative SNPs from 36 common SNPs (MAF10%) for further genotyping and association studies on an AD population. Our results showed that the IL12RB1 promoter SNPs 111A/T and 2C/T were significantly associated with risk of AD under a recessive model (P<0.001). Moreover, we observed a positive association between 111T/T genotype and total serum IgE levels in an IgE-level-dependent manner. The promoter SNPs were shown to be in strong LD with each other (D'=0.99; r2=0.85), and the percentage of 111T/T and 2T/T genotypes was much higher in AD patients than that in normal controls. Deletion analysis of the IL12RB1 promoter indicated that the 265 to 104 region that contained the 111A/T polymorphic site harbored an important regulatory element. In addition, our data revealed that a single base substitution at the IL12RB1 111 polymorphic site altered the transcriptional activity of the IL12RB1 gene such that the wild-type IL12RB1 (111A) reporter construct was transcriptionally more active than the 111T construct in Jurkat cells. These results suggested that the A/T SNP at position 111 within the IL12RB1 promoter affects the IL12RB1 gene expression and contributes to increased risk of AD as well as raised total serum IgE levels. This is supported by our data showing the effects of the 111 genotype on IL12RB1 mRNA levels in stimulated PBMC from healthy volunteers. We also found a trend for an association between total IgE level and IL12RB1 genotype among our Japanese AD patients. Thus, presence of a particular IL12RB1 allele may lower IL-12R1 expression"

Phrase: "(111A) reporter construct was transcriptionally more active than the 111T construct in Jurkat cells. These results suggested that the A/T SNP at position 111 within the IL12RB1 promoter affects the IL12RB1 gene expression and contributes to increased risk of AD as well as raised total serum IgE levels. This is supported by our data showing the effects of the 111 genotype on IL12RB1 mRNA levels in stimulated PBMC from healthy volunteers. We also found a trend for an association between total IgE level and IL12RB1 genotype among our Japanese AD patients. Thus, presence of a particular IL12RB1 allele may lower IL-12R1 expression and allow the development of AD. To the best our knowledge, this is the first report to indicate that the IL12RB1 gene may be involved in AD onset and IgE regulation. When we analyzed IL12RB1 gene haplotypes, the haplotypic findings of the promoter SNPs were weaker than that of individual SNP associations. These and our functional experiments suggested that these SNPs did not act in combination and that the 2 SNP located within the Kozak consensus sequence had little or no effect on translation efficiency. However, these findings could not exclude the possibility that polymorphisms elsewhere, in LD with the 111 and 2 SNPs, within or around the IL12RB1 gene might also influence IL12RB1 expression. Our AD patient subgroups analysis also revealed strong associations with the presence of high total serum IgE, early age of disease onset, peripheral blood eosinophilia and history of childhood asthma or allergic rhinitis.

Phrase: "IL-12R1 expression and allow the development of AD. To the best our knowledge, this is the first report to indicate that the IL12RB1 gene may be involved in AD onset and IgE regulation. When we analyzed IL12RB1 gene haplotypes, the haplotypic findings of the promoter SNPs were weaker than that of individual SNP associations. These and our functional experiments suggested that these SNPs did not act in combination and that the 2 SNP located within the Kozak consensus sequence had little or no effect on translation efficiency. However, these findings could not exclude the possibility that polymorphisms elsewhere, in LD with the 111 and 2 SNPs, within or around the IL12RB1 gene might also influence IL12RB1 expression. Our AD patient subgroups analysis also revealed strong associations with the presence of high total serum IgE, early age of disease onset, peripheral blood eosinophilia and history of childhood asthma or allergic rhinitis. Moreover, the percentage of the 111T/T genotype was much higher in child patients with asthma than that in controls as well as in adult asthmatics. Thus, specific IL12RB1 genotypes may predispose not only toward the development of AD but also toward other atopic conditions such as asthma and allergic rhinitis. In general, the clinical signs of AD predate the development of asthma and allergic rhinitis in the majority of affected patients, giving rise to the so-called atopic march, which suggests that AD is an initial step or entry point for subsequent allergic diseases (3,28). Therefore, early intervention in AD-susceptible individuals may be an effective strategy in preventing the atopic march. For this reason, IL12RB1 genotype may be an important genetic marker. The lymphocytes infiltrating unaffected skin or acute skin lesions in AD patients tend to be Th2-type T cells that produce IL-4, IL-5"

Phrase: "IL-13 inhibited the production of these antimicrobial peptides from keratinocytes (30,31). Although the exact mechanisms by which IL-12R1 regulates these pathophysiological disease features remain unknown, one possibility is that excess Th2 cytokines block a pathway of innate immune activation, leading to an increased susceptibility to skin infections. This in turn facilitates the continued activation of the adaptive immune system, including the recruitment and activation of atopic Th2 cells and perpetuation of the lesions (32). Therefore, our findings suggest that IL12RB1 SNPs or haplotypes, which appear to affect protein expression or function, may predispose an individual toward the initiation or development of Th2-mediated immune responses in the skin. Further biological and population studies will be required to confirm the role of IL12RB1 SNPs. In contrast to AD, the immune response in psoriasis is Th1-mediated and is associated with local neutrophil infiltration.

Moreover, an association between heterozygous mutations of the IL12RB2 gene and reduced IFN- production by PBMC following stimulation by IL-12 in some Japanese atopic subjects has also been reported (33) and IL12B has been identified as a susceptibility gene in patients with AD (18), asthma (34) and type 1 diabetes (35). These studies along with our present data suggest that functionally relevant SNPs in the IL-12/IL-12R and IL-23/IL-23R systems"

Phrase: "IL-23/IL-23R systems may be associated with the genetic susceptibility to a variety of diseases, including AD and TB. The human IL12RB1 gene is located on chromosome 19p13.1. Although this region has not been previously implicated by AD linkage studies, a recent study suggested that chromosome 19p13 might harbor a genetic determinant of IgE-related traits (36). Another report showed modest evidence of linkage for atopic phenotypes on chromosome 19p13.3 in an Italian population (37), and a genome-wide scan of a large cohort of German families revealed significant evidence for a psoriasis-susceptibility locus on 19p13 (38). Thus, chromosome 19p13 may indeed contain immunoregulatory genes that influence inflammatory skin diseases such as AD and/or atopy-related phenotypes. In addition, the IL12RB1 gene is a novel and attractive candidate susceptibility gene for skin inflammatory diseases such as AD, on the basis of its location as well as its function. However, further genetic analyses and biological studies will be required to address whether other atopic disease-related genes or SNPs are also present on 19p13. In conclusion, we have identified 48 variants (10 novel) of the human IL12RB1 gene. Our studies demonstrated that the 111T/T IL12RB1 genotype was associated with high total serum IgE levels and AD susceptibility in a Japanese population. Furthermore, we showed that the 111A/T polymorphism affected the IL12RB1 gene transcriptional activity and may contribute to low IL-12R1 expression levels. In individuals with the 111T/T genotype, reduced IL-12R1 expression may lead to increased Th2 cytokine production in the skin and contribute to the development of AD and other subsequent allergic diseases. Our findings also highlighted the importance of the IL-12IFN- and/or IL-23IL-17 pathway in the pathogenesis of AD"

Comparisons in reporter assays as well as quantitative PCR experiments were performed using Student's t-test. Association between log-transformed total serum IgE levels in AD patients and individual genotypes was calculated by the MannWhitney U-test or the KruskalWallis test.

Phrase: "IL-23IL-17 pathway in the pathogenesis of AD and regulation of IgE. Although the exact functional role of IL-12R1 in AD remains to be elucidated, the identification of SNPs in IL12RB1 as a risk factor for AD may provide a strategy to prevent disease onset in susceptible individuals and to represent an attractive target for future therapies for this disorder.  MATERIALS AND METHODS TOP ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION RESULTS DISCUSSION MATERIALS AND METHODS SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL REFERENCES  Study subjects A total of 382 AD patients (mean age 30.2 years, range 1665 years; 193 females and 189 males; mean total serum IgE level 2815IU/ml) were recruited from Yokohama City University Hospital and Kyoto Takao Hospital. All patients with AD were diagnosed by dermatologists according to the criteria of Hanifin and Rajka (39). Controls for the SNP association study were 658 unrelated healthy individuals with an age range of 1883 years, were from the same geographical areas as the AD patients and had no symptoms or personal and family histories of AD, asthma or allergic rhinitis. We also recruited 304 patients with childhood asthma with an age range of 415 years, who have been included in a previous study (40). All subjects in this study were ethnically Japanese and gave written informed consent to participate in the study, according to the process approved by the Ethics Committee at the SNP Research Center, Institute of Physical and Chemical Research (RIKEN). Screening for polymorphisms and genotyping To identify genetic variants of the human IL12RB1 gene, we sequenced all 17 exons, adjacent intronic sequence, 4.0kb 5' flanking region and 1.5kb 3'-flanking region in 24 individuals from our study cohort. On the basis of IL12RB1 genomic and mRNA sequences from the GenBank database (accession nos AC020904 and U03187, respectively), 25 primer sets were designed (Supplementary Material). All PCR products were sequenced using BigDye terminator v3.1 and an ABI Prism 3700 Genetic Analyzer (PE Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). The sequences were analyzed and polymorphisms identified using the SEQUENCHER program (Gene Codes Corporation, Ann Arbor, MI, USA). On the basis of information available from the public JSNP database (http://snp.ims.u-tokyo.ac.jp), eight selected SNPs were genotyped by one of two methods: the Invader assay (41) (for 111A/T:IMS-JST063138, 2C/T:IMS-JST063137, 4443C/T:IMS-JST063136, 17183T/C:IMS-JST063134 and 27637T/A:IMS-JST097711) and the TaqMan assay (for 5970G/C, 17369C/T and 25748T/C) on an ABI PRISM 7700 Sequence Detector Systems (Applied Biosystems), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Probe sets for the Invader assay were designed and synthesized by Third Wave Technologies, and those for the TaqMan assay were obtained from Applied Biosystems. Tissue expression We assessed IL12RB1 expression in a panel of cDNA tissue samples (Human Multiple Tissue, Human Immune System and Human Blood Fractions Multiple Tissues cDNA Panels, Clontech) by PCR amplification of target sequences and Southern blotting. The primer sets were 5'-CAGTGGCTCTGAATATCAGC-3' and 5'-TGCACCGTGTAGGCTACACC-3' for IL12RB1 and 5'-CCCCATGTTCGTCATGGGT-3' and 5'-GTGATGGCATGGACTGTGG-3' for GAPDH. Southern blotting was performed with a non-radioactive nucleic acid labeling and detection kit (Roche Diagnostic, Basal, Switzerland), according to the manufacturer's instructions. The probes for IL12RB1 and GAPDH were 5'-TGGCAACCTACAGCTGGAGT-3' and 5'-CCATGAGAAGTATGACAACAG-3', respectively. Luciferase assay After restriction enzyme digestion with KpnI and XhoI, luciferase reporter constructs were generated by cloning the different promoter fragments of the IL12RB1 gene into the pGL3-basic vector (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) between unique KpnI and XhoI sites. Forward primers used were: 2947/65, 5'-CCACTTGGGCCTCAGTTTCC-3'; 1668/ 65, 5'-CTGACATTTAGAGGCTTTGCC-3'; 1361/65, 5'-CAAACTCCTGACCTCGTGATC-3'; 762/65, 5'-CCGTGATTGCACCACTGCAC-3'; 265/65, 5'-ACCCTGACTTGCTCCAAAGTC-3'; 104/65, 5'-TCTCCTTGCTCAGCTTC-3', with 5'-CCGTCCCCACTCCGGAACAC-3' used as a common reverse primer. Using plasmid DNA as template, 111T constructs were created using the QuickChange Site-Directed Mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, USA), forward primer (5'-CTTTTTTCTTTTTTTTCTGTCTTTTCTCCTTGCTCAGCTTC-3'), complementary reverse primer and the various pGL3-basic clones. The orientation and integrity of the inserts for each construct were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Jurkat cells were cultured in RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2. Subconfluent cells cultured in 12-well plates were transiently cotransfected with 2g pGL3-basic vector DNA or each reporter construct and 40ng pRL-TK vector DNA (Promega) as an internal control for transfection efficiency, using DMRIE-C transfection reagent (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA, USA) according to the manufacture's instructions. After 24h, cells were harvested, and firefly and Renilla luciferase activities measured as previously described (40). Data are presented as relative luciferase activity of firefly/Renilla luciferase activity. PBMC preparation To analyze IL12RB1 mRNA expression, PBMCs from 16 randomly selected healthy individuals were isolated by Ficoll density gradient centrifugation, after which 1x106 cells/ml PBMC were cultured in RPMI-1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% HEPES buffer, 1% L-glutamine, 1% sodium pyruvate, 1% non-essential amino acids and 1% penicillinstreptomycin solution. PBMCs were stimulated with 100g/ml PHA or 100g/ml anti-CD3 antibody for 72h at 37C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. Real-time quantitative PCR Total RNA was isolated from cultured PBMC using the NucleoSpin 96 RNA kit (MACHEREY-NAGEL, Dren, Germany), according to the manufacturer's instructions. cDNA was then synthesized using the SuperScript III First-Strand Synthesis System (Invitrogen). Real-time quantitative PCR was performed on the ABI PRISM 7900 (Applied Biosystems) using an Assay-on-Demand TaqMan probe and primers (Hs00234651_ml for IL12RB1), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Relative expression levels of IL12RB1 mRNA were normalized according to GAPDH expression, using a standard curve method as described by the manufacturer. Statistical analysis We calculated allele frequencies and tested agreement with HardyWeinberg equilibrium using a 2 goodness-of-fit test at each locus. We also compared differences in allele frequencies and genotype distribution of each polymorphism between case and control subjects, using a 2x2 contingency 2 test with one degree of freedom or Fisher's exact test. All P-values are unadjusted for multiple comparisons unless specifically indicated. We calculated LD coefficients (D' and r2) using the SNP Alyze statistical package (Dynacom, Chiba, Japan), as described elsewhere (42). We estimated haplotype frequencies using the expectationmaximization algorithm. We calculated ODs with 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) using logistic regression. Comparisons in reporter assays as well as quantitative PCR experiments were performed using Student's t-test. Association between log-transformed total serum IgE levels in AD patients and individual genotypes was calculated by the MannWhitney U-test or the KruskalWallis test. A P-value of less than 0.05 was considered to indicate statistical significance.
